		      	<h3>The concept is simple: Help you land your dream job.</h3>
		      		<p>We work in an amazing industry. One that offers an abundant amount of
		      		    incredible opportunities to those willing to put in the hard work that
		      		    goes along with them. A college degree can qualify you for your dream
		      		    job but actually landing one, well that’s where it can get a bit
		      		    tricky.</p>
		      		<p>That’s where we (as in me) come in. I’m an experienced web
		      		    designer/developer from the New York area. You name it I’ve done it,
		      		    Freelance, self-employed, agency co-owner and corporate, all within the
		      		    web design/development industry. I’ve hired freelancers, employees and
		      		    contractors as well as being hired for those same positions myself. I
		      		    feel your pain.</p>
		      		<p>It’s time for something new right? That’s why you’re here. Not long
		      		    ago I too was looking for my dream job (and I found it!). But it was
		      		    painful. There were many jobs spread across a dozen sites and maybe 10%
		      		    of the jobs on a given site seemed like a good fit. I thought there had
		      		    to be a better way.</p>
		      		<p>The “better way” didn’t really exist, so I built it. The guidelines
		      		    were clean design, easy to use UI, mobile friendly, and loaded with the
		      		    best web design, development, support and executive jobs covering the
		      		    entire US.</p>
		      		<p>I hope you love it as much as I do. Good luck landing your dream job,
		      		    drop me a note when you do and tell me all about it. I’m pullin’ for
		      		    you.</p>
