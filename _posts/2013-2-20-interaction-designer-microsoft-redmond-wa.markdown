Kinect is the fastest-selling tech device of all time according to the Guinness Book of Records. It has already changed the way people interact with the Xbox, so we asked ourselves: What would happen if we made Kinect available for Windows? The answer is: almost anything you can imagine!

We’ve already seen a groundswell of interest and innovation from designers and developers around the world, and demand from our partners and customers is growing every day with the recent release of the Kinect for Windows SDK and new hardware device. Now, we’re expanding our horizons to new verticals and markets. Therefore, we need a Senior Interaction Designer to help envision and build the next generation of Natural User Experiences.

As a Senior Interaction Designer, you must have a clear understanding of each facet of the design process - information architecture + interaction design, research + usability, rapid prototyping, visual + motion design, brand integration, and content creation. You have demonstrated ability to effectively partner with product planners and managers, program managers and development and test team members to shepherd end to end experiences from concept to ship. You have deep knowledge of natural user interface (NUI) paradigms and have demonstrable experience in designing experiences with multiple input modalities. You are a great creator, collaborator, and communicator and coach.

##Primary Responsibilities include:

* Lead/facilitate design brainstorming and work sessions
* Produce scenarios, process flows, information architecture diagrams, wireframes, and other artifacts required to develop and evolve user experience designs
* Go deep on NUI and create an interaction design model that gracefully accommodates multi-user, multi-modal input across a broad set of experiences and contexts
* Help develop, manage, and refine UI pattern libraries and interaction guidelines
* Effectively communicate with developers through implementation phase to realize design vision
* Communicate, defend, and build consensus around experience architecture and interaction design direction
* Working with the User Experience Architect, project experience design efforts within Kinect for Windows’ portfolio of projects

##Qualifications include:

* Qualified candidates should have at least 5-7 years of experience
* Expertise creating a variety of interaction design documents including user scenarios, task flows, conceptual models, competitor analysis, heuristic analysis, and annotated wireframes
* Experience creating and managing UI pattern libraries and interaction guidelines ideally across a large organization
* Exposure to and understanding of variety of design, project management, and development processes and methodologies including agile development methods
* Experience shipping innovative and complex software products within milestone deadlines
* Experience managing multi-discipline design teams and design vendors in shipping compelling user experiences
* Fluency in current design and media trends
* Demonstrable ability to work confidently with Program Management, Development, Product Planning, Brand, Marketing and Usability
* Excellent communication, presentation and organizational skills
* Possess ability to think conceptually about design and information architecture
* Understand the array of technical constraints, user goals and business requirements that shape current and future products
* Proficiency with Visio, Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, After FX and all related business and design tools
* Ability to quickly produce elegant and easily understood diagrams, wireframes, and other artifacts
* Excellent written and verbal communications skills
* Strong organizational skills and an attention to detail
Startup experience is a plus!
* A minimum of a BA/BS degree in Interface Design, Interaction Design, Communication Design, Architecture or equivalent experience
