Eventup is an event marketplace that is changing the way people book and plan events. We provide people the opportunity to make money on their previously under-utilized and under-monitized assets while making it easier for people to discover amazing locations simply and easily. We launched in February 2012 and have since made it to major metros like LA, SF, NY, and most recently, Chicago. We're already seeing great traction and are backed by tech studio Science as well as some great VC firms that we will be announcing funding soon. We enjoy having fun as a company with a work hard mentality. We're right off the Santa Monica promenade, near the beach and pier, have weekly happy hours, lunch delivered twice weekly and other great perks!
