##Scope of Job 

EMG is seeking a Sr. PHP Developer to augment our progressive team of engineers. The position is for long term contract (6+ months) with intent to move to a permanent position within our company. The project we are hiring for could quite possibly be one of the coolest projects you have ever worked on. It combines front-end development with hardware integration within the entertainment industry. EMG will be using a true agile sprint planning process. This position is one among a project team of 4+ developers for this particular project. There will also be a mid-level PHP developer that you will work side-by-side with. No matter what level of engineer you are hired as, there is an expectation that you will teach and learn from your peers and teammates.

EMG offers a wide array of technical projects to work on in various languages and platforms, each with a different challenge. Our environment is set up so that our developers can touch a little bit of everything for their own experience, and that also enables EMG to deliver high quality products for our clients.

All employees of EMG must be positive with a “can do” attitude. The ability to understand risks and time/scope implications and be able to communicate those to your Director of Technology is required. There is not one person at EMG that does not have an entrepreneurial spirit. We work hard and play hard, together.

The position requires the developer to work at EMG offices throughout this project’s duration on EMG supplied hardware. EMG offices are currently located in Culver City, CA. We will be moving to our new home towards the end of Q3 2012 which is at the Hercules Campus nearly 10 minutes from the current location.
