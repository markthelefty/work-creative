##About DC Public Schools:

Our public school students need your expertise, passion and leadership.

We are looking for highly motivated and skilled talent to join our team at District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). We seek individuals who are passionate about transforming the DC school system and making a significant difference in the lives of public school students, parents, principals, teachers, and central office employees.

##Why should you work for Data Systems in the Office of Data and Accountability?

* Freedom of motion - Solution developers not code monkeys
DCPS is a highly results oriented organization and the expectation is that you deliver the tools that are needed. How those tools are built is up to you. As we do not have a formal IT department, we are in the unique position of having a lot of interesting problems with no mandate on how we go about solving them. Want to build a data warehouse using punch cards and highly trained guinea pigs? No one's going to stop you here so long as it works how and when it should. We are also not looking for cogs to slot into a machine. If you like munching through a batch of requirements and just mechanically excreting code with no thought to whether those requirements are correct, then this is not the place for you. However if you think at a higher level about process and systems and recognize that a solution has both technical and business process aspects, then you'll find a home here. If you have always wanted to build things the right way, if you are technology agnostic but prefer open-source, and if you understand the power of the 80% solution, then we want to hear from you.
* Caliber of your colleagues - Keeping you intellectually honest
A lot of organizations talk about "empowering" their staff but there are two basic requirements for that goal. The first is having relevant data and the tools to use/analyze that data appropriately. This is what most organizations focus on when talking empowerment in this context. However, just as critical is the intellectual horsepower and job engagement of the users of those tools. At DCPS in general and ODA in particular you will find your colleagues are of extremely high caliber. Though relatively non-technical, they will keep you on your A game and any inconsistencies or hand-waving will not fly. It is a thoroughly satisfying experience to build quality tools for smart, driven people and that's what you'll find here.
* Mission of the organization - Making a difference
The mission of DCPS is to educate kids and make sure both that they are given every opportunity possible and that they are prepared to take advantage of those opportunities. There are thousands of dedicated people throughout DCPS working very hard to make that happen. All of them require data or tools of some kind, and your efforts will get magnified through all those thousands of people to effect all 40000+ kids at DCPS. At very few other places will you be able to directly see your day to day work benefiting such a worthy cause.

In the end, let's face it, you will not get rich working for DCPS. We can guarantee you can make much more money in the private sector working for a startup or as a contractor. But we can equally guarantee that you will find your work here deeply satisfying on both a technical and personal level and see the immediate benefit of the fruits of your labor. We look forward to hearing from you!
