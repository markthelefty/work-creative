Nyaya Health is seeking a paid, full-time Web Developer as the 3rd member of its growing U.S.-based team. Applications are being accepted on an immediate rolling basis for candidates that are open to start work in Nyaya Health's NYC office.

The Web Developer will be provided a rare opportunity to use their skills in a critical role in an early-stage, growing organization dedicated to building health care solutions for the world's poorest people.

Are you the right fit? The ideal orientation.We are looking for a talented developer and committed self-learner hungry to use their skills for good that will build the back-end infrastructure of the most innovative, exciting, and contagious global health brand of the 21st century.

Most importantly, your orientation toward the work should match well with our operating values, or what we call our "cultural DNA". See those here.

In short, you're entrepreneurial, have phenomenal coding skills for the platform we currently use the most (WordPress), committed to learning new coding languages over time, and are excited by the challenge of being asked to take on a large, diverse set of responsibilities in the fast-moving environment of a young, growing organization.

You can't be in the market for a dry 9-5 'job', but instead, you're looking for an opportunity to use your time to transform and grow with a young organization to change hundreds of thousands of lives.

##Must-haves:

* Web development experience: At minimum, we need you to be truly talented in the WordPress platform and the skills that are important to it (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL). 1-2 years of experience delivering significant web projects is strongly preferred.
* Commitment to translating design: The Web Developer will be 1 of 3 full-time employees based in the NYC office, alongside an Executive Director and Creative Director. Thus, a close partnership will be required to work with the Creative Director to translate their designs. The Creative Director has background in web design, but only basic abilities in CSS and HTML.
* Willingness to travel to Nepal: You will be in the U.S. at least 80% of the time. But your ability to be successful depends on your ability to understand our programs, data, and reporting systems in an extremely different environment in rural Nepal. Your systems design and code are the central connection between that corner of Nepal, our team, and a broad global audience.
* A commitment to innovative development: We intend for our impact evaluation and fundraising systems to be regarded as a paragon within global health. We want you to thrive in the challenge of designing creative and inventive ways to connect people with our work while upholding the highest standards of transparency. If you have the commitment to learn, we can connect you to best-in-class tech mentors in the NYC social impact space.
* Experience in or willingness to train in Salesforce CRM: We have a newly created Salesforce CRM that needs support. You will need to be willing to provide support in integrating and automating functions across our web presence with the database. Our experience suggests that developers can self-train in the system quickly even if they haven't had much specific Salesforce CRM experience. 

##Responsibilities: 

The Web Developer will be a member of a 3-person team alongside the Executive Director and Creative Director and will be challenged over time to go beyond being a developer to also taking a lead role in designing and building creative technology systems.

* Execute the web strategy of the organization efficiently.
* Expand and maintain Nyaya Health's new WordPress-based website and blog.
* Integrate back-office systems (accounting, Salesforce CRM, development dashboards) to our donor-facing web applications for fundraising, reporting, and impact evaluation.
* Oversee migration from our current Wiki information platform (wiki.nyayahealth.org) to a more design-friendly, visual and intuitive micro-site housed within www.nyayahealth.org.
* Oversee the maintenance and use of the Salesforce CRM platform.
* Ensure the availability and security of all IT systems.
* Build creative in-kind partnerships where organizational gaps exist – in areas like analytics and SEO.
* Be our technology evangelist, internally and externally, by demonstrating an incredible passion for how technology can connect our supporters and patients in meaningful ways and make our work more efficient. 

##Location: 

Nyaya Health's new office located at 17 W. 17th Street in NYC.

##Benefits:

* Health insurance
* At least 1 trip to Nepal per year
* Connections to NYC's top social impact tech talent through organizational partnerships
* Support for professional development
