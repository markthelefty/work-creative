Expedia is shaping a new, world-class travel experience for the web. We're embracing the shift from desktops to using multiple devices, and the Global User Experience Design organization is leading the way. We're building a team of product designers that eat, sleep, and breathe Web design and the technology that shapes it.

If you can’t help but devour Internet products to understand what makes something beautiful and effective…

If you are insatiably curious about people’s needs and how different experiences can make things better in both big ways and small…

If you know how to inspire others and mentor through showing not just telling…

Then you've found your home, and we want you to join our UX Leadership team.

* Collaborate with the Director of Content Strategy and Director of Information Architecture on product design strategy
* Partner with Engineering on front-end technology and approaches to assure gorgeous, adaptive and performant user interfaces

##Technically speaking, we're looking for:

* Storied experience designing with the technical constraints of the web and devices
* Experience designing fluid grid systems and adopting or creating front-end frameworks
* Fluent in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and other web scripting languages (ability to handcode prototypes not necessary but highly preferred)

##In your portfolio, we'll be looking for:

* Ability to create beautiful designs by leveraging expert knowledge of typography, layout and composition, color theory, grid systems and use of photography
* Expertise in the aesthetics of interaction states and transitions
* Diverse and deep experience with internet products and multi-device design

##Education and Experience
