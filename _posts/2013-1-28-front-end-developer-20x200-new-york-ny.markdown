Jen Bekman Projects is looking for a front-end developer to work on our 20x200, Hey, Hot Shot! and Jen Bekman Gallery sites.

JBP consists of three programs: 20x200 is the pioneering website that offers curated, limited-edition art at ridiculously affordable prices; Hey, Hot Shot! is a critically-acclaimed international photography competition that discovers, recognizes and promotes photographers at all stages of their careers; and the Jen Bekman Gallery exhibits photography, works on paper, paintings and mixed media.

* Has a strong understanding of grid systems, composition and color, with a keen eye for typography and meticulous attention to detail.
* Enjoys brainstorming and collaboration, and can balance best practices and principles with developing innovative interactive experiences.
* Is reliable. You stick to your commitments and are dedicated to making it work.
* Has strong organizational skills and is flexible enough to roll with changing priorities and tight deadlines.

* Bachelor's degree or has equivalent experience in interactive design, computer science or a related discipline
* Expert in layout with HTML / CSS (and can speak to HTML5, responsive design and mobile web)
* Proficiency with JavaScript and related libraries (jQuery, Backbone.js, etc.)
