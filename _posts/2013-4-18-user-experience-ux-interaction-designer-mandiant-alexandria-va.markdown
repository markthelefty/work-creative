Are you passionate about designing applications that solve real problems? Do you have an interest in building products that help national security and Fortune 500 companies protect their networks from evil? Are you smart and analytical, with an insatiable curiosity about how things work? 

Mandiant, a fast growing information security company, is seeking a User Experience/Interaction Designer. At Mandiant, UX doesn’t just make things look pretty, we are involved at every level of the process—from kickoff meetings, to interaction design, to help documentation. The ideal candidate is someone who can move easily between strategy and implementation and who is able to develop a deep understanding of the business, our users, and the technology. You must have great people skills and the ability to communicate and build trust with stakeholders, customers, managers, and developers. If you love building applications, but are tired of shopping carts and social media, we have some wonderfully complex and technical design problems you can really sink your teeth into. 

##Your typical day here might include:

Starting out with doing user research with internal users and customers, then a meeting with developers to nail down feature requirements and scope. Proceeding to a rapid sketching session with the team. Partaking in lunch (yes, there is such a thing as free lunch, catered every Friday and delicious) and catching up on the latest activity of evildoers. Next, a kickoff workshop with stakeholders to develop a product roadmap. Then you’ll create annotated wireframes to release to developers and finish the day with knocking out a few buttons in Photoshop in time for a product release. If this energizes you then please read on:
