We're looking for talented iOS developers to join our team in Boulder, Colorado. Qualified applicants have built and released several iOS applications into the app store. Knowledge of Ruby on Rails and JavaScript are great, but are not explicitly required for this position.

Work from our Boulder office and collaborate with our team of developers and designers to create world class applications for startups, Fortune 500 companies and everything in between.

Quick Left is a company run by developers, for developers. We value direct and honest communication with our clients and value pragmatic solutions above all else.

Developers choose their tools and technologies. Developers run stand-ups. Developers set project pacing and schedules. We love making great applications, and we want you to come join us.

Competitive salary, excellent benefits, the latest technologies. We know what our values are and give our developers everything they need to get the job done. Benfits include, but aren't limited to: Paid vacation and sick time, 401k match, medical benefits and monthly in-office events and meetups. The fridge is always stocked and beer is on tap.

Given the hands-on, collaborative nature of our practice, we're only entertaining applicants willing to work full time at our Boulder office. Relocation expenses are covered if you're moving from out of state.

##Here's how the interview goes down:

* Let's get to know each other a little. What makes you tick? Let's talk in person, on the phone or over video chat.
* We'll dig into the technical details of your work. Be prepared to talk about your experiences solving business problems with software.
* We'll invite you in for some pair programming. We'll write some code together. This is where it gets fun.
