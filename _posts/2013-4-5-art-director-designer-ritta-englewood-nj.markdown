We need an experienced art director / designer with many talents. If you have the right combination, you can unlock the door to a fantastic opportunity!

If you are that designer, you totally understand and adhere to corporate and product branding. But that doesn’t stop you from having fun creating a wide range of branded content across all media platforms – print, packaging, digital, video, experiential, etc. We will look to you to help create innovative online design for websites, banners, landing pages, emails, and more.

Because you’ll be working closely with your teammates, you play well with others. Better yet, you inspire creativity in others.

##You are…
* Able to judge and organize information for idea/concept generation.
* Able to sell your work internally and to the client.
* Confident and professional.
* Highly organized, with attention to detail.
* A self-starter able to prioritize multiple work assignments and meet deadlines.
* Fluent in InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop and Dreamweaver. (Any knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript earns brownie points.)

##You also have…
* A unique, original portfolio of diverse creative work demonstrating a strong understanding of online trends, technology and design. 
* Experience creating branded micro-sites for products and content. 
* Knowledge of industry best practices in web design, interactive design, and social media trends.
* An affinity for marketing high-end and luxury brands, and an enthusiasm for promoting automotive, consumer electronics and home appliance products.
* Excellent oral and written communication skills.
* 5 years’ agency experience – especially working with brand style guides.
