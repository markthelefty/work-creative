##The Vision
Every day, we work on a product that is changing people's lives at work. We believe that everyone deserves to use software that is useable, simple, and beautiful, whether they use it in their personal lives or for work. Yammer empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent, more equal way of doing their jobs. To change more lives at more companies, we're now a part of Microsoft, but we run independently - and quickly - in London and San Francisco.

##The Gig 
Help us lead the London edition of Yammer's User Experience Team as chief user advocate. You'll be a critical part of every London feature from conception to launch, working constantly with product management, research, engineering, and QA.

We need designers who are great communicators and problem solvers with dead-on interaction instincts, but who know how visual UI design can affect the experience. We need both concise wireframes, and flawless visuals, but we know that they are separate skills and not mutually exclusive to create the best experiences. 

##Responsibilities
* Lead the UX design process for product features that will be released in London
* Practice a highly efficient, iterative design process with light documentation
* Negotiate and articulate the "why" of design decisions. You'll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.
* Provide interaction/visual specification with visual styling, wireframes, workflow diagrams, and interactive mockups
* Communicate frequently with the UX Team in San Francisco to keep consistency with the user experience

##Requirements
* 3-5 years of experience (or comparable) at various companies designing great consumer facing or enterprise products
* Designed and launched multiple products/major features/apps. 
* Experience working with cross-functional teams in a rapid paced environment
* Knowledge of technology advantages and limitations required (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML)
* Expertise in Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle or Photoshop.
* A portfolio online or in PDF format 

##Bonus Points
* Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements
* Experience working remotely
* Previous work experience with user research
* Ability to provide production ready files to engineers 

##The kind of people we're eager to work with are:
* Full of empathy for users
* Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art
* Excited not daunted by the fact that designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research
