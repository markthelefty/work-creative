Constant Contact’s CardStar group is growing quickly and looking for people who are passionate about mobile, consumer-facing applications, and helping small businesses engage with their customers.

Our team is still small, so your input will help shape our vision, your skills will help define our capabilities and your contribution will be highly visible within the company.

This is a unique chance to work in a fast-paced startup environment inside an established, market-leading public company.

##Job Description:

You live and breathe mobile and you know it’s the future. Your networking icebreaker is to show off apps you’ve written on the Google Play market. You have rock-star skills but are looking for a startup with job security whose apps touch millions of users. Wait, is that possible? Yes! Sign up with us and here’s what you’ll help us do:

* Design the UX for our new consumer-facing apps
* Develop our next-generation apps for Android (both phone & tablet)
* Integrate with the latest consumer loyalty technologies
* Work with our web service developers on client-server APIs and protocols
* Contribute your ideas and sparks of genius to our roadmap

##Here are the skills and experience we need from you:

* One or more native apps published on Google Play
* Passion for mobile development and user experience design
* Respect for and understanding of the latest Android design principles and guidelines (unless you have a better solution)
* Solid knowledge of recent Android additions (and deprecations)
* Experience with automated testing and continuous integration
* Comfort in working fast with a small team with a lot of responsibility
* Desire to grow your skills and acquire new ones
