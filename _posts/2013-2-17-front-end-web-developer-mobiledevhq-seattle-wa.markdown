We're hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.

App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there's a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.

You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in everything you do.

##What you'll be doing at MobileDevHQ:

* Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.
* Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.
* Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.

##What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:

* Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.
* Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.
* Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.
* Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.
* A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren't building an average company, and we don't want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren't afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.

##Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:

* We're crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing. We've signed up hundreds of active paying customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.
* Well compensated. We're a startup, but we offer a full compensation package. You'll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).
* Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We're a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily -- you'll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.
