Come build a team and grow with LaunchWare. It’s a great opportunity to be a pivotal player and create awesome applications. This is a full time position. Help lead a growing team and establish yourself as an authority in the Boston development community.

We have many exciting projects to get involved in, and we continue to seek clients that have significant social impact or provide tangible business value.

##You will:

* Ensure that software delivered is delivered qualitatively
* Lead and mentor a small group of eager learners
* Work in a results only environment. Work where and when you want, as long as the work gets done.
* Work with a very small and innovative consulting company that endeavors to delight its clients
* Work directly with clients to discover and confirm requirements
* Solve interesting problems in the simplest way possible
* Write well tested and expressive ruby
* Integrate design patterns and architectural techniques that help web applications scale and change with requirements
* Build rich internet applications with JQuery and Backbone.js along with other exciting client side technologies
* Write tests first and implementation second
* Build and maintain Rails 3 applications
* Write semantic, W3C compliant markup and unobtrusive, object oriented javascript with JQuery and Backbone
* Work directly with the company’s principal and founder, Dan Pickett and a growing team of enthusiastic developers

##What We’re looking for:

* A proven track record of building and deploying quality web applications
* Clean, well thought out code
* Solid communication skills as indicated from references. To be an effective leader, you must communicate extremely effectively
* A strong, insatiable desire to learn and hone your craft
* Practical, demonstrated knowledge of web standards and best practices in front end development (HTML5/CSS3, Semantic Markup, Progressive Enhancement, W3C compliance, etc)
* A demonstrated understanding of the Rails framework and MVC fundamentals
* Three years experience in the web development field, preferably with interpreted, back-end technologies
* A proficiency in object oriented design and architecture

##It would rock if you:

* Have team leadership experience
* Have demonstrated leadership abilities outside of development

The ideal candidate gets excited about learning new things and working with various parts of the Rails stack. Your goals should include establishing yourself as a helpful and integral member of the Web Development community at large. If you don’t want to build and share your knowledge, this is not the gig for you.

Resumes are great, but practical application and endorsements from your peers, employers or clients will secure the position. We are extremely selective, so be prepared to justify why you think you’re the best at what you do.

Most work can and will be done remotely, but we find pairing and collaboration to be most effective when we’re physically working alongside each another.

##About the Company:

LaunchWare is a web development consultancy that loves to ship. We work towards establishing quantifiable value for all of our clients. We refine, build, and deploy quality software that solves real problems. We speak business first and geek a close second, ensuring that clients get software that solves their problems as simply as possible. We are firm believers in the promises of Agile Development methodologies and efficient web frameworks. We are lifelong learners, teachers, thinkers, and innovators.

In the next year, we plan to continue building great applications for our clients. We’re also building training programs, publications, and our own products as well. Come help shape the vision and be part of the founding team.

It’s truly an opportunity to get involved in some great projects and learn a lot. We hope to hear from you!
