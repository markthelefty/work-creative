You: Motivated & talented designer with a knack for creating easy-to-use & clean web apps. You believe communication is the key to good working relationships and helping others understand your vision. You desire a role where you will have a tangible and meaningful impact on the product.

This role requires a mix of UX design, visual design and basic prototyping skills (HTML, CSS, some JS). You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you are open to learning from data & qualitative findings and incorporating those into your work, this may very well be the perfect role for you.
 
Experience working within an interactive or UX agency environment with a variety of clients is desired. Enterprise and/or mobile experience is a huge plus.
 
##REQUIREMENTS

* Online portfolio with sample workflow designs and projects from start to finish (a link is required)
* Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches & wireframes
* Demonstrated experience developing and designing: wireframes, mockups, site maps, storyboards, task flows, design specifications, and/or landing pages
* Strong design background with expert knowledge of page hierarchy, typography, color theory, and branding
* Open to learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas
* Work within and manage a design styleguide
* Expert in full Adobe CS suite
* Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.
* Familiarity with usability testing and incorporating findings to designs
* Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment
* Possess a self-motivated, driven work ethic
* 5 years minimum experience designing a mix of brand elements and user experience design flows
 
##IS LIFTOPIA A GOOD FIT FOR YOU?

Beyond the typical startup/tech industry benefits (like unlimited vacation, health insurance, bonus pool, flexible schedule, stock options, and so on), Liftopia would be a great fit if you identify with any (or all!) of the following:

* You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.
* Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire & effort to grow and remain relevant.
* Company culture - like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days - appeals and is important to you.
* You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you're curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).
* Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.
