Don’t be mistaken; our “Junior” design position comes with serious responsibility. Our design and marketing team is growing and we’re looking for a young designer with chops to run with the big kids.

A candidate’s portfolio demonstrating creative talent, exceptional sense of typography, and creative use of images with overall simplicity and a powerful sense of communication will grab our attention. Strong knowledge of web production and design software including Adobe Creative Suite is necessary. Working knowledge of CSS/HTML is definitely needed. 1-2+ years experience with designing for eCommerce and / or online consumer facing brands will help seal the deal. Oh, and you should probably own a bike.
