Xactware Solutions provides computer software solutions for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building and repair.

In 1986, Xactware opened for business with Xactimate, its flagship estimating system. Xactimate helped contractors and insurance adjusters estimate repairs much faster and more accurately than they ever could before. Since then, Xactimate has evolved into a high-powered package complete with a patented plan-sketching program, and Xactware has become much more than just Xactimate.

Today 22 of the top 25 property insurance companies in the U.S. use Xactware property insurance claims tools. Xactware features software solutions for every phase of a building's life: from remodeling to totally replacing a building, from determining the cost of rebuilding a structure to preserving and repairing a home.

Xactware also provides tools to estimate personal property, emergency repairs, and more. Xactware users can work on a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or "on the cloud" using browser-based solutions. Estimating products are connected to a comprehensive set of tools that includes an assignment network, analytical reports, cost research, project management, and third-party products. The online training center provides users with high-quality training on Xactware solutions and the construction industry.

Xactware reinvests heavily in research and development as well as in the quality of people who develop its products.

Xactware is a member of the Verisk Insurance Solutions group at Verisk Analytics.
