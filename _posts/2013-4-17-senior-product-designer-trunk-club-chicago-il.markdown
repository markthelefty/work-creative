##About us:

Trunk Club (trunkclub.com) was started to solve a simple problem – shopping for clothes in stores or online just doesn't work for most guys. It’s overwhelming, inconvenient, and takes way too much time. With Trunk Club, guys discover awesome clothes that are perfect for them without ever having to go shopping.

We combine top brands, expert service, and unparalleled convenience to deliver a highly personalized experience that helps guys look their best and saves them time. We start by scouring the planet for the very best in men’s apparel, curating an ever-evolving assortment of pieces from our favorite designers. With the best inventory anywhere as our point of departure, an Expert on our team hand-selects a trunk of items based on each customer’s needs and tastes. They keep what they love and send the rest right back to us, at no cost to them.

Our team is based in Chicago, IL and has grown from four to over one hundred since starting out in December 2009. We are backed by awesome investors, including US Venture Partners, Greycroft Partners, Anthos Capital, and Apex Ventures.

We solve difficult technology problems every day with the goal of scaling our service platform to a large, diverse customer base while also increasing operational efficiency. We are a small, agile development team with fast iterations and high degrees of personal ownership, so we see the results of our code immediately.
