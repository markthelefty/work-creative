Are you a student or self-taught web designer looking for a break into the industry? Are you frustrated that to get a position in the web design industry you need experience, but no one will hire you without experience? We are looking for recent graduates and entry level web designers who want to put their skills to use and learn all the things you can't learn in school or on your own by reading books.

This position will focus on talking with customers, supporting the websites that our senior design team builds and interacting directly with clients. Duties include designing promotional material for client websites, making simple HTML or CSS changes, hand coding website pages that consist of images and text, and learning more than you can imagine on a team that dominates in our industry.

If this sounds like an exciting time and great opportunity, please contact us. We are beefing up our team and currently have multiple openings for this position.

##Our perfect person has

* The ability to write and edit HTML and CSS
* Loves working with people; great at explaining complicated tech jargon
* Experience with Photoshop (even if you know just enough to be dangerous)
* Excellent written and verbal communication
* Outgoing and upbeat (we're all just a bunch of geeks and nerds)
* Able to pick things up quickly and learn new technologies
* Up to date with online trends such as social media and online payment methods
* Previous domain, DNS, and SEO experience is a huge plus
* Takes pride in their work and genuinely wants to do a good job

##Job details

* This is an in-house position and we work Monday through Friday 7:30am to 4:30pm
