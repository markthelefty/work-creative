Perform visual design and production duties for interfaces to appear on phones, tablets, and computers running the iOS, Android, OS X, and Windows operating systems, including the development of backgrounds, typography, icons, custom controls, and animations for mobile apps, packaged software, and web-based application interfaces.

##How you’ll do it

* Participate in product envisionment, prototyping, and development support.
* Specify visual, animation, transition, and audible aspects of beautiful, coherent, and highly functional interfaces.
* Collaborate with the Industrial Design, Copy, Marketing, and Branding teams to develop interface designs that marry product positioning and brand, supporting the Belkin identity and the product’s naming.
* Actively support ongoing development of guidelines for Belkin apps including brand standards within the Belkin identity.
* Ensure quality fit and finish of delivered interface work and the preservation of that high level of quality in the implemented product.

##What you’ll need

* Four year college degree in visual design or related field or comparable years of work experience preferred.
* 5 – 7 years related work experience within software UI design and development.
* Significant experience designing interfaces and producing visual assets for iOS and Android.
* Experience with highly iterative and interactive development cycles collaborating with a software UI prototype/developer.
* Effectiveness in designing and producing effective, pleasing, and usable interfaces demonstrated by a strong portfolio that includes shipping products of notable quality.
* Familiarity with interactive UI design patterns, usability, and the unique constraints and idioms of mobile design.

##What you’ve done

* Stay abreast of developments in mobile, software, and web interface design, incorporating findings and new ideas into your work when it benefits the people who will use the product.
* Work with related personnel such as user experience designers, industrial designers, engineers, and product managers to create great product experiences.
* Plan and initiate usability testing and other research activities that inform your work.
* Actively manage your own projects like an internal consultant: on-time, on-budget, no surprises.
* Help Belkin to further integrate user-centered design methods.
* Supervise outside vendors if needed for your projects.

##What you’re getting into

We’ve got big collaborative spaces for your big ideas, so bring an open mind and leave your suit in the closet. We all are committed to creating unique and rewarding consumer experiences. Everyone is interested in succeeding – for the team, for themselves and for the business. Cross-functionally and across the company, everyone has common goals and aspires to be their best.

You will learn something new or at least look at things differently every day. There are so many smart and creative people around that you’ll be motivated to pursue the ideal.

Team spirit is infectious. Belkin is an extremely open workplace, where communication is essential. Not every idea will be accepted, but you’ll be asked for your point of view. Innovation thrives on multiple and varied levels. At Belkin we challenge conventional wisdom and refuse to accept that something cannot be done.
