American Masters, Thirteen/WNET’s award-winning biography series, celebrates our arts and culture. Created and launched in 1986 by Executive Producer Susan Lacy, the series set the standard for documentary film profiles, accruing widespread critical acclaim – 50 Emmy nominations and 23 awards – including for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 – the 2012 Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Producer of Non-Fiction Television; an Oscar, three Grammys and 12 Peabody Awards.
 
American Masters has produced an exceptional library of 180 titles, bringing unique originality and perspective to exploring the lives and illuminating the creative journeys of our most enduring writers, musicians, visual and performing artists, dramatists and filmmakers – those who have “left an indelible impression on our cultural landscape.”
 
Reporting to the Executive Producer of American Masters, this newly created position is responsible for devising and implementing short- and long-range strategies for enlarging and stabilizing the American Masters franchise, with a senior role in both external and internal (WNET) initiatives and communications.
 
The Director will be responsible for developing innovative thinking and forging relationships to further the reach and scope of the series beyond broadcast into the digital space, publishing, creative partnerships with universities, libraries and other organizations; for evaluating and activating renewed and original exploitation of the assets of the American Masters archive; for considering and planning new spin-offs, sub-sets, mini-series etc. based on existing and future American Masters programming - all with an eye to maximizing the educational,digital, social media and revenue producing possibilities for both the existing library and future productions.
 
This effort will entail developing media and other creative partnerships--both digital and analog, in film, production, literary and visual media--as well as potential funding partners--individuals, philanthropic and corporate--including developing promotional tie-in and event opportunities.
 
The Director’s role will also entail coordination of all grant proposals to foundations, governmental organizations and PBS, collaborating closely with WNET Development staff. This individual will manage internal communications between the series and all relevant departments at WNET—the VP Programming, Interactive Engagement, Law, Human Resources, Station Relations, Communications, Program Publicity and especially Development and Major Gifts -  and will be primarily responsible for working with Communications to coordinate press efforts, press releases and events, including screenings, station outreach events and the TCA.
 
In addition to strengthening the reach of the series through potential digital partnerships, this position will entail continued and expanded work with WNET's in-house on-line and web department to enhance the work currently being done with the series programs, especially in the area of educational materials, DLOs etc. - including finding the funding to support these expanded efforts.
 
To qualify, candidates must possess a Bachelor's degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff. Candidates must also have thorough knowledge of budgets and budget management; of rights and clearance issues; excellent oral and written communication skills; strong planning, organizational and relationship-building skills; knowledge of the independent production community; and ideally, some experience in fundraising. Familiarity with digital and online would be very desirable.
 
Candidates with solid experience as executive or senior producer or in a development & planning role, in network, cable or independent production, with a successful history of developing projects, creating alliances, and fundraising – are preferred.
 
**This is not a position for an active film-maker or would-be producer for American Masters – though film and production experience will be essential.  Rather, this is a critical senior administrative role in planning, strategy, communications and development.**
