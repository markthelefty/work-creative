MarkITX is looking for a front-end developer to join our team. We want colleagues who are smart and get things done, who are inveterate builders, tinkerers and detectives. We hire people not experience levels, so we have a place for you whether you have built your own MVC framework or are fresh out of school.

MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $20MM in orders and over $150k per week in transactions, roughly doubling every month. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale that.

The best consumer web apps have far surpassed the best enterprise apps in terms of user experience. Our enterprise users are accustomed to absolutely horrible user experiences with existing options. This gives us a massive opportunity to wow our users with the kind of consumer-grade experience they’re getting used to out of the office.

##We Expect

* You’re more excited about what you can learn, than by what you already know
* You can take a project from problem, through ideas and user testing to implementation
* You want to work with a startup, and all that entails
* You have a set of tools that you know intimately
* You’re happy to give and receive thoughtful criticism
* You will quickly get comfortable with our Node.js, Backbone, Handlebars, LESS, Brunch
* You’ve used a VCS, and can quickly get comfortable with Git & GitHub
* You’ll commit to production on your first day
* You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can move with the right team around you

##We Provide

* A team of world-class sales, marketing, engineering, design, data and operations experts who are excited to teach you, and to learn from you
* A top-level commitment to open source. We publish and contribute, and you will too.
* An amazing work environment at 1871, the heart of Chicago’s digital startup ecosystem
* A competitive compensation package, including equity participation and health
