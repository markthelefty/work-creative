ZocDoc is seeking front end developers who love to build web pages that are exceptionally usable and universally astounding. You mostly live in the worlds of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but you also understand the full stack because you know it makes you better at front end. You care about the quality of your code and the products you build more than anyone you know. You care deeply about the experience of using your product.

##Working at ZocDoc
We were recently named the Best Place to Work in New York City by Crain's New York, which means that they asked everyone who works here how much they loved their job and everyone answered in the range of "a lot" to "a helluva lot." The truth is, we have a lot of fun doing our job. We get excited about driving conversions and building slick UIs cool enough to blog about. We go on semi-annual hackathons to remote, exotic places (like the Catskills and Long Island!). Pizza and beer are never far away. Neither are granola and tea, for that matter.

##Our Offices
We work in a massive loft-y space in the heart of SoHo. Devs get top-notch gear (24gb RAM, 4 monitor setups, etc) and interact a lot with the rest of the team.

##We want someone who:
* Crafts beautiful cross-browser compatible pages
* Is expert at Javascript (you write your own jQuery plugins)
* Is driven by an unknown force to change healthcare for the better
* Knows how to test the UX of what they build

##As a ZocDoc employee you get:
* A feeling of accomplishing something genuinely useful to humanity
* Relocation fees fully covered
* A competitive salary
* Free catered lunches every day
* 100% employer-covered health insurance
* Stock options
* A hoverboard*
  *subject to availability

If this sounds like the gig for you, send us your resume and in your cover letter tell us what we should change to make our website, zocdoc.com, even better.
