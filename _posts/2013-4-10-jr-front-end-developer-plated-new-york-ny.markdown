Plated is looking for a junior front-end developer to join our team.

We are a NYC tech startup that is redefining the way we eat and reconnecting people to their food, one plate at a time. Plated was founded by two Harvard Business School graduates less than a year ago. Since then we have received funding from an exceptional group of investors (including one of the Facebook co-founders and well known NYC seed fund), been featured in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, and been accepted into the most competitive startup accelerator in the world, TechStars. You will be joining a small and energetic team composed of the next big movers and shakers in tech; our co-founder Nick Taranto was recently featured in Forbes’ 30 Under 30.

As our young company is taking off, we need to rapidly expand our developer team – that’s where you come in! Why us? This is a wonderful opportunity for a junior front-end developer to learn and have an impact; you will gain back-end proficiency while working hand-in-hand with our senior developer who has over 15 years of experience. Beyond brute intelligence and problem solving skills, we are looking for hunger, passion, and a general craving to help us change the way people eat.

##Responsibilities
* Maintain and create new features for responsive website.
* Develop integrations between Plated website and 3rd party APIs.
* Understand and create an outstanding online experience for your target audience.

##Qualifications
* Energy, Energy.  You really want to work with us and learn how to build a company.
* Undergraduate degree or minimum of 1 year of hands-on front-end web development experience (or dev boot camp)
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Ability to self manage
* You love food

##Technical Requirements
* Proficiency in HTML, CSS and github.
* Strong skills in Javascript.
* Understanding of how to connect to external APIs.
* Exposure to jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails preferred.
* Bonus points for cloud services and Pivotal Tracking use.
