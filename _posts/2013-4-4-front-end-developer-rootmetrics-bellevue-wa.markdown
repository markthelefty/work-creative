You breathe, sleep, and eat code. You know how to make one design work in 47 different kinds of device/OS combinations using only CSS.  You take great personal satisfaction in squeezing out the last 150ms of load time out of your app framework. Charts, graphs, and data visualization turns you on. Designers love you because you know what an em is and you wear great shoes. (Ok, that last bit is optional. The great bit, not the shoes bit.)
