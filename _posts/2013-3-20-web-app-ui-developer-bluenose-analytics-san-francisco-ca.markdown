Bluenose Analytics is building a CRM for the subscription economy by creating value from the intersection of product usage and CRM data.  Our initial analytics application gives SaaS vendors an "early warning system" of reports and alerts to drive better trial conversions, prevent churn and grow recurring revenue.  For example, SaaS users with declining product usage might be at risk to renew their subscription.  Bluenose spots these patterns and alerts the vendor before it's too late. We are backed by top-Â­-tier venture investors.
