You will work closely with our clients, developers, and designers to create business-oriented applications for the Android platform. You'll be working with a world-class team of engineers who are passionate about what they do - and will expect the same from you.

* Enterprise, SaaS, or cutting edge Android development 
* 5+ years of Java software development (3+ years programming on Android devices) 
* Knowledge and demonstrable work on the current Android platform, including the latest ICS and Jellybean versions
