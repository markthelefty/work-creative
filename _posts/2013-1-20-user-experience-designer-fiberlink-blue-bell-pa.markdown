##COMPANY OVERVIEW 
Our mission is simple. Empower companies with mobility through a 360-degree view of enterprise device management — giving users the flexibility to work anywhere, and IT the tools to secure, monitor and maintain their mobile assets. We believe that a cloud-based delivery model is the only way to lower mobile expenses and risks while providing faster results than alternative solutions. A comprehensive and consolidated view of mobile devices and all enterprise computing assets — in a solution that is constantly maintained and updated without interruption — is the key to greater operational efficiencies and minimized costs and complexity for IT.
