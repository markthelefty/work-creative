Do you have a favorite taco joint where you are a local celebrity? Or a bar where everyone knows your name? Here at Belly we eat, breathe and live for those situations.  We've been told we are the MJ of loyalty, the Oprah of rewards and the Ron Burgundy of fun. But we are humble and our goal is simple: to put smiles on our customers’ faces and help our businesses build a deeper relationship with their customers.
 
We are looking for an excellent front-end developer with a passion for beautiful application design and product development.
You must be a wizard at JavaScript and have a strong appreciation of current and emerging standards.  We’re expanding our product offering to mobile and tablet via PhoneGap and we have extensive back end and customer facing platforms which require sexy UI / UX goodness.
 
While this position isn’t for a “designer”, you will still have very strong product instincts and be competent with illustration and design.
 
We are looking for the best Developers in Chicago and pay will be extremely competitive. 
 
##Required Skills / Experience

* Good startup mentality (we have passion for what we do)
* A desire to work hard and be part of something
* Appreciation of current and emerging standards
* Some Server-side application development in Ruby on Rails and either PHP or Python is beneficial
* Extremely strong JavaScript skills (we use jQuery)
* Confident problem solver and troubleshooter, and you proactively challenge traditional solutions (break the mold).
* Illustration, design, product development, user experience
* Fun to hang out with
* Unit testing (something like QUnit)
* Appreciation of the entire web stack (a life-cycle developer)
* Internationalization
* SQLite / Gears / et.al.

Salary is dependent upon experience, but we want only the best..... so again, it will be extremely competitive.

Starting immediately!
