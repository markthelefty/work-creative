##Who We Are Looking For:
We are looking for an experienced PHP backend developer who thrives on finding clever solutions to knotty problems to help us build a suite of web applications that are lightning fast and built to scale in the cloud to be an anchor member of a fast-growing development team. You'll be starting with a Drupal 7 code base, but should expect to work toward migrating away from Drupal to achieve these goals.

##Candidates Should Possess:
* Strong debugging and general analytical skill and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment juggling multiple tasks
* Minimum 5 years of experience working on high-volume, high transaction, commercial web applications in multi-server, load-balanced environment
* Very strong PHP skills. You should be able to write basic CRUD for an object with nothing more than a text editor and access to a web server running stock Apache, PHP, and MySQL in 15 minutes
* Very strong HTML skills. This is not a front-end position, but we expect you to be comfortable writing clean, syntactic HTML.
* Fluency in the MVC pattern and Object-Oriented development
* Sufficient comfort with Apache and MySQL to be able to manage your own dev environments and assist with other environments when needed
* Experience with Drupal a plus, but not required
