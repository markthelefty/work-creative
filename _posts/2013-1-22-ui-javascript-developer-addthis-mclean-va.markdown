##About The Job

Our JavaScript tools are loaded billions of times per day, across the web (not a typo). We're looking for an amazingly talented front-end developer to help us take the next step with the world's largest content sharing platform and social toolset, AddThis. You'll work as part of a small, focused team on sophisticated client-side solutions for the social web.

##Primary Responsibilities
* Working with a small team to contribute to the design and implementation of core product features in our client toolset, using JavaScript and related web technologies
* Managing your development pipeline â€” being able to identifying and prioritize tasks as well as execute on them
* Producing software designs and test frameworks in addition to feature code
* Contributing strong expertise in specific client-side technical areas to the team as a whole

##Required Skills/Experience
* B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent
* Experience in a small-team environment working on a commercial software product
* Strong expertise with modern frameworks such as jQuery (though we're more interested in frameworks you've written on your own)
* Total comfort with light-weight and/or Agile development methodologies
