##About StackSocial:

* What: StackSocial powers digital commerce across the web with an online marketplace of over 200,000 active members.  Our digital commerce platform provides web publishers a simple and effective way to generate additional revenue by organically weaving flash sales on relevant digital products & tech gear into the reader’s daily experience by channeling the StackSocial storefront directly into each publisher’s site.
* Where: Founded in 2011, StackSocial was accelerated at Amplify.LA and is now headquartered right across from the beach in soulful Venice, California. 
* Why: We're changing the way web publishers engage and monetize their audiences.  Publishers hold a captive, passionate fan base; yet most aren't able to engage with their fans via ecommerce, email marketing, and site registration.  StackSocial changes this by enabling publishers to offer sales on hand-picked, trending products.
* Who: We’re a team of entrepreneurs who previously worked at companies like Meebo, Klout, Yahoo!, PopSugar, and our own entrepreneurial ventures. We’re backed by a group of top-tier investors including Draper Associates, 500 Startups, Siemer Ventures, Paige Craig, EchoVC, and others.

##What you’ll do:

* Breathe Life into Ideas. Help us revolutionize digital commerce to change the way people discover and buy products on the web.  Take product insights and business needs and translate them into elegant and efficient user experiences. Solve challenging issues to understand what features our users want before they even ask for it.
* Play Well with Others. You are a great software engineer in general; know a few languages, and especially javascript, html5, css3 inside and out. Can possibly overlap a little with the backend guys…knows a little about ruby/python/php or similar, along with a selection of web frameworks. Knows MVC, and understands its use-cases.
* Impress our customers. Constantly advocate for the best customer experience possible while balancing design and business objectives. Demonstrate deep understanding of customer interactions to transform complex design requirements into intuitive interface.  Create world-class customer experiences and beautiful visuals that support and reinforce StackSocial’s vision, brand, and business objectives across all platforms.
