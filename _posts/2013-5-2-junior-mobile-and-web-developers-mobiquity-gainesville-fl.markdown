Remember when every mobile application was "out-of-the-box," because no one had ever built anything like it?  Forget that -- remember when saying "out-of-the-box" was actually an "out-of-the-box" thing to say?  Then you'll understand Mobiquity's excitement about designing and supporting applications for the old school companies for whom mobile is truly something new.

As you may have heard, we are planning to open a new Delivery Center in Gainesville, FL. Gainesville is where a lot of the magic is going to happen, and we are looking for bright young minds to help create incredible software experiences that will be touched by thousands, if not millions of people. Bright young minds who have -- or haven't! -- studied the computer sciences, but who most definitely *have* dabbled in mobile / web application development. You're unrelentingly passionate about the mobile experience, whether your course of study focused on the ethical ramifications of the Gaia Hypothesis as it relates to environmental preservation or the leaf depth and familial structure of (a,b) trees.
