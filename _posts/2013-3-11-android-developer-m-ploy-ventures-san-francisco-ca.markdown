You will be working within a small and tightly focused team of experts, and while expectations are big, the egos are not. This is a company of technology and game enthusiasts; we all love what we do, take pride in our work, and have a good time while doing it. You should feel similarly and expect nothing less from your position at Blue Shell.

##Responsibilities:

* Own our Android technology stack.
* Help us create great UI for strategy and simulation games on touch devices.
* Work with top-notch visual and game designers.
* Expect a custom, high-performance backend purpose built for your client.
* Grow into greater responsibility as the company expands.

##We believe:

* Less is better.
* Android devices are a platform like no other.
* Passion is a competitive advantage.

Preference given to candidates with relevant shipped products, ideally games. Demos, code samples or even gameplay videos are always appreciated and count for a lot.

This is a full-time position at our office in SOMA, San Francisco.
