We're bootstrapped, profitable and proud. You'll be working with our team of
developers building cool stuff, with amazing people. Here's what some of our 11
person crew have to say about Litmus:

"Everyone. Gives. A. Shit. (about the tech, the products, the customers, each other). Trust and ownership are important here. We build products that scratch our own itch. We experiment, we celebrate (big things (like throwing a launch party), and small (beers at the end of the week)). Oh, and there's no red tape, bullshit posturing, timecards or org charts!"
**Eddie, Ruby Developer**

"Aside from software architecture and syntax, there hasn't been a task that I have begun that I have known how to do. It is a constant learning experience and we often times find ourselves building things that have never been built before."
**Justin, C# Developer**

"We're in charge of our own future and aren't beholden by a board, investors or anyone else. I feel like the people I work for care more for our customers and their employees than most other companies do."
**Justine, Marketing**

"Super cool office! - Our office is amazing and we do a lot of cool things here. Kinect + beer fridays + fun :) It's also easy to get to and a great location."
**Danielle, Support**

"The "founders" are in the thick of it. Also, the collective responsibility, I feel like I could rely on any team member for help."
**James, Account Manager**

##About The Position
We offer everything you'd expect from a cutting edge, financially successful start
up. Great salary, full health care benefits, 28 days paid vacation (yes, on top of
public holidays!), beautiful office space complete with a Kinect, beer fridge and
Sonos sound system. We also buy you lunch, every day.

You'll be working with the very best money can buy: SSD drives, dual Apple
Displays, Aeron chairs, huge desks, 10" tablets and whatever else you need to be
awesome at what you do.

Did I mention our office? Seconds from the Central Square T in Cambridge, we have the 11th floor to ourselves. Stunning views, beautiful furniture and top of the line equipment. You have to see it; it's stunning. Design is a key selling point of our products. We're looking for someone to take over responsibility for all aspects of design and user experience at Litmus. We'll give you all the resources and support you need to craft beautiful, elegant experiences that delight our customers.

##You'll be responsible for:
* Designing the user interfaces for all our web-based products
* Working closely with our development team to oversee the implementation of your designs
* Co-ordinating user testing of our product and your own prototypes
* Jumping in to help with user experience decisions whenever they arise

##The ideal candidate has:
* Portfolio showcasing excellent skills in design and UX principles
* Solid understanding of layout, typography, color and other design principles
* Strong attention to detail
* Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
