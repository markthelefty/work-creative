The role that JavaScript plays at Harvest is growing every day. You'll join our front-end team in solving problems, building new features and making Harvest better and better. If you have experience with a nimble team where things progress rapidly then you'll feel right at home at Harvest.

Harvest is a distributed team. We have a lovely big office in New York City, but team members live all over the USA, Canada and Europe. Wherever you currently live, that's where we want you to be.

Did we mention a sense of humor yet? It's important, we like to have fun while we work.

##Who You Are
* You have unrivaled attention to detail.
* You believe it's worth doing some extra work to make life easier on the customer.
* You like writing CoffeeScript, but can write vanilla js without breaking a sweat.
* You are familiar with Backbone and Ember and have an opion on what makes them good/bad/meh. Maybe you've even built projects in both.
* You know that performance is king and have optimized your code for a wide range of browsers and platforms.
* You write code in a modular, reusable fashion. Perhaps you've released open source code that demonstrates these qualities.
* You believe that a task is not complete until a test is written.

##A Sample of Tasks and Projects You Might Work On
* Build new Harvest features and improve existing components.
* Build a select box plugin for use in Harvest.
* Build a cross-platform framework to support the mobile web component of Harvest.
* Build a state manager for CSS media queries

##To Apply
* Please make sure you fit the descriptions above (see the brain!). You must be authorized to work in the United States (unless you intend to work remotely from your home country).
* Email us at careers@getharvest.com with the subject "Harvest Front-end Developer."
* Tell us why you want to work with us, and why you'd make a good fit here.
* Give us your thoughts on the eternal JavaScript debate: semicolons - yes or no?
