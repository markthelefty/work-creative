##Roles and responsibilities	
###What is Brafton Graphics Like?
We are passionate about information design and struggle to understand when numbers and stats are misrepresented. We research to discover narratives that become visually communicative.

As a team our days revolve around deadlines, clients, team brainstorm sessions, critiques, a demanding schedule that values quality as much as turnaround and a workload that's only for the strong. Oh and we also love puns and discovering narratives in random statistics. Still reading? Then we want to hear from you. 

Located in the heart of Boston's Financial District, Brafton's Graphics team has grown immensely since late 2011 when it was an army of two.

This is why the team has been one of the fastest growing and most innovating within the company.
