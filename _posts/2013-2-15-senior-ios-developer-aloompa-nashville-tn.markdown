Some current clients include Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, Electric Forest Festival, Mountain Jam, Hangout Music Fest, and many others (more at aloompa.com). We’re not looking for divas. We require someone who wants to grow and reap the rewards that come with working in a small and agile team. You would be responsible for contributing to the full software delivery cycle:  feature definition, planning, estimation, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
