Are you looking to build software that matters? Do you want to work with a brilliant engineering team that really cares that users love their software?

AppFolio is a fast growing and funded startup in Santa Barbara, CA that is focused on building exciting web-based business applications that customers rave about. We take pride in finding new ways to delight our customers.

You will join our engineering team to design and build user interfaces that are used millions of times each month and help to make people's lives a little bit better. Although all our engineers work across the entire development stack, we are looking to hire specialists specifically in the front-end who can provide expert level guidance to our team and stay on top of emerging technologies.

##We are looking for people with expert-level proficiency in:

* HTML(5)
* CSS(3)
* JavaScript (and libraries like jQuery, Modernizr, Backbone, Underscore, etc..)
* Cross-browser support and progressive enhancement
* Web Inspector/Firebug including the JavaScript debugger and web console

##Expert-level proficiency means:

* You follow industry leaders and the latest w3 specs to stay on the cutting edge of new technology.
* You’ve downloaded and installed nightly builds of Chrome, Webkit, and Firefox just to try out new features.
* You don’t just use JavaScript libraries, you know how they work. You’ve probably submitted patches to popular libraries or even built your own.
* HTML semantics is important to you; you’d never have a hard time deciding between using a '*div*' and a '*ul*'.
* You have a solid understanding of CSS selector specificity and you don’t resort to just adding another ID to make one rule trump another.

##If you have one or more of the skills below, even better:

* Experience with Ruby on Rails or similar MVC application framework. 
* Experience with SASS, Compass, CoffeeScript or other language preprocessors.
