Sony Corporation of America, located in New York, NY, is the U.S. headquarters of Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo, Japan. Sony's principal U.S. businesses include Sony Electronics Inc., Sony Mobile Communications (USA) Inc., Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC, Sony Network Entertainment Inc., Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Sony Music Entertainment, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, and Sony Online Entertainment LLC. With some 900 million Sony devices in hands and homes worldwide today, a vast array of Sony movies, television shows and music, and the PlayStation Network and the Sony Entertainment Network, Sony creates and delivers more entertainment experiences to more people than anyone else on earth.

Sony Corporation of America (SCA) is seeking a results-driven, experienced Web Producer to join our Global Experience Design team located in the dynamic SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. Our job in the Experience Design team is to create websites that people love to use, and to create digital content that reminds the world what it is that they love about Sony products.

Under the supervision of the Web Production Manager, this individual will work with a multi-disciplinary creative team tasked with delivering compelling digital product experiences that help bring Sony products and services to life online to connect with the hearts and minds of our consumers.
The Web Producer must have excellent relationship building skills, robust problem solving skills, business acumen, and the verbal and written communication skills necessary to engage a diverse set of stakeholders including upper management-level employees.

Web Producers are very much the heart of our projects and the glue that holds our creative efforts together. While a project manager may be adept at scheduling, coordinating project efforts and resources, Web Producers must also possess a visceral understanding of creative development in all its forms as well as the ability to both facilitate creative dialogue and faithfully represent creative work to internal stakeholders and vendors.

Our ideal candidate must be a highly organized, ambitious self-starter who is at ease in a scrappy, start-up-within-a-large-corporation atmosphere.
