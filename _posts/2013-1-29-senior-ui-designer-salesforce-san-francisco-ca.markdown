Salesforce.com transformed the enterprise software market with cloud computing. We've launched business apps and platforms that are as easy to use as Amazon.com and as social as Facebook. Recognized as the world's most innovative company and the third fastest-growing technology company by Forbes and for the third consecutive year in 2011 selected as one of the "Best Places to Work" by FORTUNE magazine, we now have our sights set on the next generation of cloud computing. Our technology teams are the brains behind visionary technologies like the Force.com platform, and enterprise social collaboration tools like Salesforce Chatter and the AppExchange marketplace. With more than 7,000 employees, the first enterprise cloud computing company to exceed $2.0B in annual revenue run rate, and more than 100,000 customers worldwide, we are proud to contribute to the success of companies of all sizes and industries, around the globe. If you're passionate about innovation, come help revolutionize how companies collaborate and communicate.

Desk.com is a fast-paced startup inside Salesforce.com, which means you get the best of both worlds: small teams, fun projects, and fast execution backed by the vast resources of a publicly traded company. We have the cool vibe of a startup and the dependability of an established player. We are headquartered in San Francisco and have really cool offices south of Market.

We are seeking a highly-motivated Sr. UI Designer with a strong understanding of design, to contribute in shaping the user interface of our product and strengthening our online presence across web, tablet, and mobile devices. We drive our product by the user experience, and need someone with the skills who can keep up and push the vision forward.

You will work directly with other members of the product team to build experiences that reinforce the Desk.com brand and help wow our customers. You will get to work in an exciting and engaging agile startup-like environment where you will be encouraged to expand your skills, test your creative boundaries, share new ideas, and most importantly - have fun.


##Responsibilities:

* Design, iterate, and refine UI and UX concepts for the company's core products.

* Work directly with product managers, front-end engineers, and other UI designers to insure we maintain a high-quality user experience.

* Work collaboratively with your team to meet the demands of our customers, while at the same time continuing to innovate far beyond the competition. .


##Required/Desired Skills:

* You are a master of your craft and tools. As a designer you are expected to have a dominating control over Photoshop, as well as create satisfying interfaces boasting user-centered design principles for our core applications. Bonus for a dribbble or other online portfolio.

* You get excited to work with some of the coolest clients on the web on a product that people love using. With customers like 37signals, Rdio, Square, Pandora, many more, we're building software that real companies are using and we need you to contribute to our evolution. You must be excited about your role! Anybody can build something that's "good", but true passion breeds "incredible."

* You like to deliver real results. So, you've got some design and prototyping chops but do you have the ability to bring your work to life? This is a great opportunity to expand your front-end skills, and learn from an exceptionally talented team. You'll need to be able to build those great experiences with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bonus if terms like HAML, CoffeeScript, and AngularJS not only make sense to you, but excite you.

* On occasion, you will have to receive feedback from our customers - so excellent written and oral communication skills are a must!
