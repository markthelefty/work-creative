##About SurveyMonkey

SurveyMonkey is the world's leading provider of web-based survey solutions, but there's really much more to us than that. We're a smart, passionate group of people who work hard to deliver the best survey experience on the planet, period. We do this because we believe everyone deserves easy access to the insights and information they need to make better, more informed decisions.

We're also proud to admit that despite our incredible growth over the past 10 years, we refuse to grow up. We are still small and nimble; everyone plays an impactful role; and when we say good ideas can come from anyone, we mean it.

SurveyMonkey is trusted by millions of customers, including 99% of the Fortune 500, as well as other businesses, academic institutions and organizations of all shapes and sizes. In any given month, we collect more than 40 million survey responses from people in all countries around the world.

##About Wufoo

Hey, Superfriends! Wufoo and SurveyMonkey Needs You!
Our team is on the lookout for some amazing people with creative energy, innovative skills, a passion for great design and all things tech to join us. We need your help in continuing to build both Wufoo and SurveyMonkey into user experience powerhouses.

Here's the Wufoo story in a nutshell:  Chris Campbell, Kevin Hale and Ryan Campbell founded Wufoo in 2006 on the belief that forms were the starting point for building anything useful on the web. The problem they saw was that one of the most efficient and used interfaces for collecting data, wasn’t very efficient to create. After 6 months of development, the three founders built Wufoo, a web application that removed the inefficiency and tediousness out of the form building process. Wufoo reduced what used to take days (if not weeks) by trained professionals into something that could be done by anyone in minutes.
