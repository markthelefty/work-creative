Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment Business is revolutionizing entertainment through experiences built on Xbox 360, Xbox LIVE, Windows Phone, and other platforms and services. We're fun. We're social. And, we’re growing!

The Operator TV Technology and Services (OTTS) UX team is looking for a Senior Experience Designer to shape the next look of television and entertainment experiences in Microsoft.

You are able to think about blue-sky concepts, and then turn them into detailed designs that can be implemented. You are able to synthesize technical constraints, user goals and business requirements into product designs that are scalable, simple, and elegant. A sense of humor and passion for creating experiences that people love is a must. Sounds like you? Apply today!

*  Work with user researchers to coordinate testing efforts, interpret test results, and incorporate results into design efforts
*  Help develop, manage, and refine UI pattern libraries and document interaction guidelines
*  Effectively communicate with developers through execution phase to realize design vision
*  Communicate, champion, and build consensus around experience architecture and interaction design direction

##Qualifications:

*  Qualified candidates should have at least 7-10 years of professional experience
*  Expertise creating a variety of interaction design documents including user scenarios, task flows, conceptual models, and annotated wireframes
*  Experience working with researchers to integrate both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies into product designs
*  Exposure to and understanding of variety of design, project management, and development processes and methodologies including agile development methods
*  Experience shipping innovative and complex mobile, web or TV-centric products using related technologies and frameworks
*  Experience managing multi-discipline design teams and design vendors is a plus
*  Fluency in current entertainment and social media trends, especially in broadcast TV and gaming
*  Excellent communication, presentation and organizational skills; have conviction to represent UX/Design to others, including leadership.
*  Proficiency with Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office and all related business and design tools
*  A minimum of a BA/BS degree in Interface Design, Interaction Design, Communication Design, Architecture, or equivalent experience
