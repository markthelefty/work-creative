##What you would do: 

As part of our growing and passionate team you'll participate in everything from initial planning and sketches right through design and implementation. You'll be based in our Beaverton, Oregon office, designing world-class UIs that are perfectly simple and eminently usable.

##Here's how we work: 

We work in an agile team environment. We discuss a project, make prototypes, code them up, then work with developers to make sure those designs look and work exactly as intended. You'll also work alongside our testers, who are great at spotting usability problems. As a designer you're engaged in the whole process â€“ from conception to launch.

##Requirements

* Solid understanding of modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
* Marketing automation website integration experience required. (Domain expertise)
* Demonstrated knowledge of best practices for the design of digital interactions
* Solid experience in interaction strategy, user research/usability testing, and the construction of software prototypes
* Experience with visual design, skinning wireframes, icons, and style guide creation preferred
* A demonstrated design sensibility and a knack for producing effective, engaging interaction prototypes
