##The Position:
You are passionate about creating quality user-centered design. You live for facing down and solving tough design problems. You thrive in fast paced, iterative design environments and possess clear, effective communication skills. You work collaboratively across the organization – while also working independently. You pay attention to the details without forgetting the big picture. You have vision, moxie, and a track record that shows both. You love working with a small, quirky UX team that preaches, teaches, and gets their hands dirty in the name of getting things done.

##Job Responsibilities:
* Design, wireframe, and document user interfaces and user experience improvements for an enterprise cloud-based software solution.
* Work collaboratively with the UX team, product managers, and developers to design next-generation user interfaces and solve ongoing usability problems.
* Be a positive, engaging force for UI and UX within the organization and proactively find opportunities to improve our customer’s success.
* Create and present your design work in industry standard mockup and wireframing tools (and ideally in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

##Requirements:
* 3-5 years of experience designing enterprise and/or technical web applications.
* Proven track record for designing compelling, accessible and standards-based user experiences.
* Expert user of design and prototyping tools (e.g. Axure).
* Solid understanding of the advantages and limits of web pages as design surface.
* Work collaboratively with disparate, cross-functional groups.
* Multi-task, prioritize and communicate progress effectively to multiple stakeholders.
* Synthesize feedback while maintaining ownership of the design process.
* Strong sketching/drawing skills and/or wireframing electronically (e.g. Balsamiq).

##Desired Skills:
* Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (e.g. Informatics, Design, Computer Science).
* HTML, CSS and Javascript (JQuery) prototyping skills.
* Knowledge of usability and user research best practices and techniques.
* Solid understanding of typography, color, imagery, composition and other graphic elements.
* Experience with Agile and Scrum development process.
