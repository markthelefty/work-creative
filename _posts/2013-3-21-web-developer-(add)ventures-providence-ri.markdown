##Job Summary:
We are looking for an engineer that is ready to make the move from daily hands-on coding, to leading technical initiatives (with a bit of coding thrown in). This position is a fantastic opportunity for the right person, but is not a fit for every engineer. If the following “criteria” match your experience and goals, read on:

* You are experienced developing web sites or web applications
* You are as comfortable speaking to people as cranking out code
* You can juggle priorities while getting things done
* You are looking to be more involved in the development process, rather than being a developer

The Lead Web Developer is instrumental in coordinating the development of websites, web applications, mobile applications, social media applications and technical R&D. You will work collaboratively with clients, graphic designers, and coders to define and execute all aspects of our development plans. In addition, you will be involved in supporting existing web-based applications
