Are you an engineer who is passionate about creating user interfaces within scalable frameworks that are easy to maintain? If so, we want to talk to you!

En Masse Entertainment is looking for a Senior Rails Applications Engineer to work with us in our efforts to establish a network of sites aimed at supporting our current and future games. The ideal candidate will be someone who is familiar with building complete websites using Rails and who stays current on emerging and changing technologies that can be used to enhance existing sites. This candidate should be someone who realizes that a web site is never "done" and is constantly looking for ways to tweak our framework and applications to polish an awesome user interface even further. Lastly, we're looking for someone who is passionate about the gaming industry and eager to work on projects that span the company.

##To give you an idea of typical tasks, over the last few months, our web developers:

* worked with the maintainers of the RefineryCMS open source project to optimize and enhance the underlying framework of our site's content management system.
* created a development environment capable of automated deployment by both developers and designers using Chef and Vagrant.
* worked with our Network Operations department to ensure that current and future site technology will deploy to QA and production environments using Chef.
* developed a Ruby app (using Sinatra) to utilize a series of RESTful API calls for a web storefront
* implemented security patches to site dependencies
* made our automated tests more robust
* wore a wizard hat when they broke the production site
* bragged over their current position on the in-house leveling leaderboard for TERA

If these tasks sound like fun to you and you would thrive at performing these tasks with beautifully elegant code, send us your resume!

##Qualifications

* bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience
* experience developing web-based frameworks and applications (using Ruby/Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
* familiarity with version control systems, especially Git
* passion for video games, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games

##Fun Factors

* game area and LAN center on site
* free snacks and sodas in the kitchen
* open floor plan where team members collaborate with one another on the fly
