Do you like epic design challenges? Do you want to leave your mark on an industry that affects everyone? At Practice Fusion, we believe in the power of great design to create a massive, positive impact in the healthcare industry, and we are excited to find someone to share our mission. 

We are reimagining how doctors treat their patients, how patients engage with their healthcare, and how a growing number of new devices inform people about their health.   We value designers who obsess over elegant interactions and strive to delight users. From the product vision through execution, we are building a team to perform research, create scenarios and frameworks, refine the user experience, and collaborate with product and engineering to make it all a reality.

Practice Fusion (www.practicefusion.com/careers) is actively recruiting for a senior interaction designer who is both idealistic and pragmatic. We’re looking for someone who pushes the envelope on how we communicate value through design and is eager to tell stories that engage doctors and patients alike.

* Create remarkable designs for a very wide variety of areas of our products

* Help to develop a pattern library of exceptional design principles
* Deliver and take responsibility for interfaces from concept to final delivery
* Manage multiple projects/tasks of varying complexities
* Meet deadlines and work well under pressure 
* Work independently and collaboratively. We use paired design when appropriate
