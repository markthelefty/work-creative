##Here's what we are looking for:
* We are looking for someone special to join our team.
* We want to hire a friendly, organized, design-savvy internet geek.


##To be specific, we want:


Someone who loves the web as much as they love a challenge,
a strong communicator who writes well and communicates clearly and someone that is willing to think outside of the box.


##Here's what you'll be doing:
You'll be a guardian of all things front end. You'll be working closely with your team members & managers to deliver beautifully designed and hand-crafted websites.


##To be exact, you'll be:


* Creating proof-of-concept mockups & prototypes.
* Writing large amounts of clean HTML, CSS & Javascript.
* Discussing features and how to best implement them with your team with an emphasis on usability.
* Working in an agile-driven environment.


If you have experience with Coldfusion, HTML5, or any of the javascript frameworks like jQuery or MooTools, that would be a huge gold star. Even better, if you have experience with mobile e-commerce you should probably just go ahead and apply.


##Your day will consist of:


* Grabbing a banana or some grapes before you start your day, provided by build. (optional)
* Grabbing a free sugar-free Rockstar to get the creative juices flowing, provided by build. (optional)
