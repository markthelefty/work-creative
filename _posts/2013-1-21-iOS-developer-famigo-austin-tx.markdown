##About Us:

Famigo is a startup company based out of the Austin Technology Incubator.  We're a small team of highly dedicated people, and we're all passionate about everything Famigo. It's our mission to make mobile technology work for families.

We currently need a motivated person to help build the iOS version of our application, the Famigo Sandbox. We are always pushing the limits on how the Sandbox helps families, so it is constantly evolving.

* Good visual design aesthetic and creative drive with a passion for user experience
* A passion for great user experiences across users of all ages
* Incredible work ethic
* The desire to produce great code
* Sense of humor
* Appetite for tacos

##Bonus Points:
* Experience with iOS Core Graphics and Core Data
* Experience shipping at least one iOS app that is currently available in the App Store
