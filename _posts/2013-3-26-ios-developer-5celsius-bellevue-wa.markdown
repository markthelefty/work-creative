We have several existing and deployed apps that require an internal iOS developer to hop into and continue developing. We are a small and very fast moving company that is funded and growing. Our apps are used by our enterprise clients (Brooks Shoes and Titan Electric) in the field, retail stores, and at expos. Your work will be extremely visible and public, our ClearGait app is in use in 40 states and 16 countries. You need to have mastery of CoreImage as CG involves a lot of video and image manipulation.

This position is a contract to hire, we are looking to trial someone and hire them full time as an essential member of the team. Our environment is very much that of a startup, and you'll need to do a lot of heavy lifting and independent work. Our office is in Bellevue and is a loft-style open office with giant windows and high ceilings. Be ready to work hard and make some waves.
