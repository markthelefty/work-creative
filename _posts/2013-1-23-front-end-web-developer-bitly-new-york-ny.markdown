You enjoy bending the DOM to your will, crafting rich, performant cross platform interfaces, and making browsers do things they didn't know they were capable of doing. You manipulate CSS/JS as if they were silly putty. You'll be working from the application layer forward (server-side), working closely with both our UI/UX team, and our infrastructure team. Python experience is a plus.
 
##You have the following:
* A strong understanding of JavaScript outside of libraries / frameworks, i.e. the language itself, not just how to use jQuery, Mootools or Dojo.
##Deep understanding of:
* Events
* Remote Data
* Closures
* The DOM
* Object Prototypes
* Data Types
* Scope
* Detailed knowledge of CSS, the box model, semantic markup, and HTML5.
* Experience with performance tuning re: script / css / image loading.
* An understanding of application side security models, client side app hardening, XSRF, etc.
* Experience with a version control system (preferably git or svn).
