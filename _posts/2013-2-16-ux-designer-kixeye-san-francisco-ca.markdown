KIXEYE is currently looking for a kick-ass UX Designer. You’ll get to work with all our game teams, as well as help support our new platform. You’ll be responsible for requirements gathering and creating wireframes/flows to support our UI team in the creation of assets for all of our products. It also goes without saying that you need to fight for the user day in and day out!

##What you get to do everyday:

* Provide comprehensive designs for all our games’ new features, specifying layout, functionality, and flow
* Gather design requirements from appropriate stakeholders
* Advocate and lead UX discussions; achieve best-possible designs
* Drive design thinking and champion the UX vision across the organization
* Brainstorm, research, wireframe, design and refine user experiences within product requirements and deadlines.
* Collaborate with other designers, program managers, and engineering teams, working to prioritize UX design
* Create wireframes, workflow diagrams, mockups and design specifications required for proper implementation.

##What you bring to the role:

* 3+ years of experience in applied UX design,  Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Solid portfolio demonstrating your UX skills with examples of process used on projects (please specify work done individually or with a team)
* A passion for UX and keeping current with recent usability trends and best of practices.
* Experience working with Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Visio or other UX wireframing tools.
* You must be comfortable with a motion driven process. UX design is highly iterative and includes multiple rounds of brainstorming and revisions to find the perfect solution
* Exceptional communication skills with the ability to present and explain UX ideas and concepts effectively whether verbally, written or through visuals
* Open minded and collaborative approach to UX with the ability to take direction and constructive feedback and use it to create easy to use solutions
* Ability to produce in a fast paced environment with a dedication to iterate in pursuit of the best UX solutions
* Self-motivated worker with ability to prioritize and manage work load to meet critical project deadlines
* A desire to grow your skill sets and broaden your experience
* A sense of humor. Or, openness to the occasional, unsolicited dick/fart joke
* Be an avid gamer! Live and breathe games!

##Stuff that helps:

* Undergraduate degree or equivalent certificates in interaction design, industrial design, graphic design, or other UX design-related field; Master’s degree preferred
* Experience working in a game development team as a user interface designer, artist, or game designer
* Strong communication and presentation skills; ability to present design solutions for game UX
* Strong project management skills; ability to manage schedules and identify project needs and priorities
* Strong knowledge of PC and console games; familiarity with MMO and shooter games
* Hands on familiarity with Flash
* Art skills—not required, but nice to have
* Hands on familiarity with HTML and CS
