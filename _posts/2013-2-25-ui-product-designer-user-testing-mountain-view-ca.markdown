<http://UserTesting.com> is a fast-growing start-up in Mountain View (right off 101) in our 5th year of business.  We’re in the business of helping website managers answer one question: “WHY are people leaving my website without buying?”  We do that by recording ‘think-aloud’ videos of people using websites, so you can quickly see why they get stuck and frustrated.  We’ve become part of the website and mobile improvement process for companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Walmart, and Twitter.

We’re looking for a smart and energetic Product Designer who's all about design that is easy to use. From conception to sketches to iteration to production, be prepared to own and organize your work.  Ideal candidates will successfully take charge of entire features, pages, and apps.  Experience working with engineers is an absolute must.

We have a STRONG preference for someone who can work on site at our office near Google in Mountain View.

##Responsibilities:

You’ll manage new products through their life-cycle, from design to implementation. Responsibilities include:

* Develop mockups, wireframes, specs, and other guides for development for new features and products
* Web site design
* Conduct usability testing
* Collaborate with sales, marketing, engineering, and customer support to prioritize needs
* Gather and incorporate feedback from customers and internal teams
* Manage multiple projects and initiatives simultaneously

##Our Ideal Candidate Has:

* 3+ years of experience as an online product designer
* Knowledge and experience in the field of usability
* Product development experience at a start up
* Agile development experience
* Experience with project management and productivity tools
* Proven track record of delivering projects on time and on budget
* Strong teamwork and communication skills

##Bonus Points for:

* Knowledge of UserTesting.com and other usability tools
* Product Management Certification or related degree

##What We Offer: 

* Competitive compensation
* Health insurance
* IRA plan with matching contributions
* Paid vacation and company holidays
* Education reimbursement
* Gym membership reimbursement
* Paid time off to work at a charity or nonprofit of your choice
