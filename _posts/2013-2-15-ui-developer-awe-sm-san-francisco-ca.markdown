##Why us: help solve hard problems that create real value for business

Nearly every website, mobile app, or marketing campaign has a social layer now, but too few companies make use of the incredibly valuable social data generated each day by their own users.

awe.sm has built a powerful platform that captures these data, connects them to real business goals, and enables our customers to harness the results to create value through our growing toolset, robust APIs, and integrations with leading 3rd-party tools.

We've proven the value of our technology to a growing number of real customers – from startups to the Fortune 500, and now we're ready to grow our team, our capabilities, and the reach of our platform. Our goal is to help our customers harness the rich intent and effectiveness data from social interactions to build more compelling applications, produce more relevant content, and market more effectively – anywhere social is driving value, awe.sm can help.


##What's the job: turning Big Data into Great Info

We are collecting enormous amounts of data, and are constantly coming up with new things we can do with it. Your job is to take the power of our APIs and focus it down into clear, easy-to-understand interfaces that help our customers see what's going on and make use of that information to meet their goals. You'll be extending our GUI as well as knocking out prototypes that demonstrate to customers all the ways they can use the data our platform can provide.

We want you to think creatively and come up with novel, illuminating interfaces that make the value of our data more obvious, easier, and more fun to use. We're not going to be handing you a PSD and telling you to get all the pixels lined up; we're going to be explaining a problem and looking to you for a solution that nobody's tried before.


##Who you are: excited just from the job description

We need an experienced developer with a proven track record of getting things done on the web. We're also looking for someone deeply interested in user interface design and the presentation of information. Ideally you'll have built something in this area already, even if it's just a side project. We want somebody who uses JavaScript for more than form validation, and knows more than just jQuery.

Most of all we're looking for honest enthusiasm: does the idea of building big new things and having to learn a lot to get them done fill you with a burning desire to get started right away? Then you're the person we need. We want somebody who has big ideas and the technical chops to bring them to life.


##About the company

awe.sm works with hundreds of customers large and small, from startups like Zaarly, StockTwits, and Topspin Media to not-so-startups like Groupon, Zynga, and Gilt Groupe. We’re backed by leading VC firms and are expanding from a team of 5 to 10–15. The salary is competitive and comes with a generous stock option plan as well as full health, dental and vision coverage.

As a technology-driven business, we are creating an engineering-driven organization. Personal development is one of our highest company priorities, and we believe that technical development is essential to a strong engineering culture. That translates into code reviews and tech talks to promote learning and assigning projects in ways that help team-members explore their interests first-hand. We hope this will be your favorite job, but we doubt it will be your last and we want every member of our team to walk away from this experience better equipped to pursue their own goals.


##About the tech

Our current front-end code is mostly in PHP using the Zend Framework (we like MVC, but are not big fans of Ruby on Rails). We want somebody unafraid of learning new languages and APIs to get things done. Our user interface is HTML5 with a lot of Javascript for visualizations. You'll probably be pleased to hear that we do not support IE 6.


##About the team

We're a close-knit team. It should go without saying since we're a startup, but we work flexible hours in casual dress. We mostly work out of our offices on the 6th floor of the US Bank building in the Mission, featuring truly awesome views. We value our ability to concentrate, so we're a pretty quiet room and everyone's got headphones, but our IRC room is always active, with both technical arguments and the latest YouTube videos. We eat lunch together every day, and socialize after work regularly. We are increasingly good at throwing surprise birthday parties.
