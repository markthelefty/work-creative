We are a close-knit customer acquisition technology team focused on building applications for a business that The New York Times has called "revolutionary" in the world of retail/e-commerce. Our technology stack is modern and designed for engineer happiness.  We build primarily in Rails 3.2, Coffeescript, HAML/SASS, Backbone.js, and other awesome technologies.

##You'll be really happy here if:
