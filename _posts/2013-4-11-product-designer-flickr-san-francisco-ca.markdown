* Develop storyboards, mockups and prototypes to effectively communicate interaction models and design ideas to the team.
* Define design strategy, project approach and scoping for your projects. Drive new features and improvements across the Flickr product.
* Identify appropriate user research techniques and metrics for gauging success. Work with researchers and project team to iterate designs based on test feedback.
* Communicate design strategy to the Flickr team and incorporate feedback from key stakeholders.

##Minimum job qualifications:

* Minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a key member of user experience team with a history of designing for large-scale web, mobile and/or desktop applications.
