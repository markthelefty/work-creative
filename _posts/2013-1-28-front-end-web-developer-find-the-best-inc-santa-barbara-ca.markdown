##Who we are:

We are empowering people to make quick and informed decisions by providing a cutting edge decision making platform of the future. Behind the scenes we are building an intricate data-driven content platform, which we believe will be the google/wiki of structured data. More than 14+ million people a month use our services to make important life decisions!

Our team previously built the online advertising platform DoubleClick.

##What we're looking for:

We are looking for passionate and talented programers that get excited about our huge ambitions, love tackling big real-world problems in practical ways, and view coding as fun, not work!

##You should:

* Have a passion for solving big problems in creative and ground breaking ways.
* Enjoy working in a collaborative team environment

##What we use:

* PHP
* JQuery
* MySQL
* Redis
* MongoDB
* Sphinx
* Ubuntu on Lenovo, but Mac works as well!

 

##Compensation:

While Kleiner Perkins is our venture capital firm we can't give you a private jet to fly to a private island, but you can use our comparison to FindTheBest one (fractional-aircraft.findthebest.com). We will negotiate a package that allows you to enjoy sunny Santa Barbara (Silicon Beach as we call it) and share in the future success of the company! Our fringe benefits include time-off when the surf is pumping, impromptu team outings, and ownership of your own projects.

##If Interested:

Submit a resume with past projects, a brief bio, and relevant URLS (github, stackoverflow, personal website, etc...).

 

##About the Company:

We've been called "a different approach to search" by the New York Times, and "the more talented offspring of Wolfram Alpha and Google Squared" by Search Engine Land. Michael Arrington (TechCrunch) even told readers to "keep an eye on this one - it's for real."

FindTheBest is an unbiased, data-driven decision engine. We collect, organize and present data in a consumer-friendly format so our users can quickly make informed decisions. Each month, 14M+ users view our content on 800+ products and services across 10 verticals.

We're backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, and our founder/CEO previously started DoubleClick (sold to Google for $3.1B). Located in Santa Barbara (Silicon Beach), we're a fast-growing, fun place to work. Career opportunities abound for all smart students: from front-end and software engineers, to non-technical Product Managers, to writers and marketers.

We look forward to hearing from you!
