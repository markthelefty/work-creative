Wallaby has one mission: To simplify people's lives and help them save money by providing automation and intelligence for everyday payments. Our founders have extensive payments and data experience. We’re building the team to take on established players and change how people think about paying. As part of that effort, we’re seeking a software engineer who is comfortable with both front-end layouts and back-end controllers to build out our consumer-facing web offerings.

We are an agile shop and make extensive use of Ruby, Padrino, Bootstrap, ember.js, Coffeescript, and RESTful APIs alongside the usual HTML5 and CSS. You'll be tasked with driving the development of Wallaby's responsive user experience, and with organizing the code into manageable modules that can be reused and expanded upon as we grow. If you want to disrupt the payment system that everyone uses every day and have a blast doing it, send us your resume!

Our headquarters are nestled in Old Town Pasadena just blocks from the 210 Freeway and LA’s Metro Gold Line providing easy access to all parts of Los Angeles. Old Town features more than 80 bars and restaurants for every meal of the day and our building includes a beer garden downstairs. We furnish the office with extensive snacks and caffeine in all its forms.

Wallaby Financial is a venture-backed startup whose investors include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund FF Angel, WI Harper Group, Quotidian Ventures, Karlin Ventures and a great group of angels. We are committed to the success of both Wallaby and each of our employees and your career goals.
