Purpose creates 21st century movements. We deploy the collective power of millions of the world’s citizens and consumers to help solve major global problems. To do this, we develop and launch our own technology-driven social and consumer movements from concept to execution, using our model of movement entrepreneurship, and we partner with progressive businesses and existing organizations to create new initiatives at the intersection of mass participation, social innovation and the new economy.
