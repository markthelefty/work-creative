Eze Castle Software is looking for a talented User Experience (UX) Designer to join our Boston-based team. As a member of our UX team, you will work collaboratively with the product management and development teams to transform functional/business specifications into highly polished, intuitive UIs.

This position affords opportunities to work across a broad range of UX-related disciplines, from UI prototyping and interaction design, to usability testing and information architecture. The ideal candidate will be a well-rounded UX generalist who combines outstanding design skills with strong analytical, technical, and problem-solving abilities.

##Job Functions:
* Work closely with product managers to understand complex functional requirements and transform them into detailed design specifications
* Effectively communicate design recommendations using wireframes, flowcharts, high-fidelity design comps, interactive prototypes, and the occasional cocktail napkin
* Create production-ready assets (icons, application themes, etc.) using design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Expression Blend
* Advocate for the needs of end-users throughout the product design process; evangelize & promote good design principles and best practices throughout the organization
* Independently manage multiple, concurrent projects in a fast-paced development environment, proactively ensuring that appropriate UX considerations are made throughout the SDLC
* Work with project stakeholders to build consensus behind the best practical (not always the best possible) design solutions; produce final design specs that balance development deadlines and implementation costs against key design considerations
* Perform UX reviews for projects in active development to ensure that they adhere to design specifications and established style guidelines
* Organize and facilitate small-scale usability tests
* Help define, document, and communicate formal style guidelines
 
##Qualifications:
* Minimum 4-year degree (B.S. or B.A.), ideally in a related field (design, HCI, human factors, computer science, technical writing, psychology, etc.)
* 1-3 years of experience designing, developing, or documenting complex software solutions for the web or desktop environments; mobile design experience is a plus
* Familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite; working knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator
* Thorough understanding of fundamental design principles and usability heuristics; ability to articulate the reasoning behind design decisions and communicate effectively with non-designers
* Prototyping experience strongly preferred — e.g. familiarity with WPF, XAML, C#, Expression Blend, Flash, Cocoa, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, or similar. We currently use WPF/XAML for the bulk of our prototyping work. At a minimum, the successful candidate will be tech-savvy, curious, and motivated to learn new skills.
* Proven ability to create polished, professional designs that anticipate and accommodate the needs of users
* Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume, and a portfolio of recent design work.

##Benefits: 
Compensation includes a competitive base salary, performance bonus, 401K matching & excellent benefits.
