Hey, designer! 
Acquisition requires a unique skill that you have. You know how to inform and entice all while keeping it simple. You understand how to create a campaign across the globe. You know and understand how to draw people in with just the right amount of context. Do you have ideas how to communicate Netflix’s offer to the world? We want to hear from you. 
 
##About You

You’re truly talented—recognized among your peers as the best. Your portfolio inspires and impresses other designers. Frankly, it also makes them a little jealous. 

You’re an innovator by nature.  You “think” AND “do”. You’re smart, confident, highly competent—and mature enough not to have an ego. You’re a skilled communicator who welcomes honest, candid feedback. You believe that the best designs prove themselves in the marketplace, and you think of data and testing as allies in creating the best possible user experience. 

You have exceptional visual skills, and impeccable sensibility for color, composition, form and story. You’re a genius at solving interactive problems—and you’re passionate about exploring new frontiers in web, TV and mobile interface design.

Now is an especially exciting time to join our design team. We’re growing rapidly and we have multiple openings. If you’re ready to add your vision—to imagine an alternate future—this is a rare opportunity. The things you discover and create will have widespread impact.

##About Us: 

This is a place where talented, curious people come together to share ideas and solutions. Although Netflix is an established company, in many ways we still act like a start up, allowing us to act quickly on emerging business opportunities. 

When we find the right people, we value them deeply—our compensation, benefits, and culture are hard to beat. We also believe creativity comes from happy, fearless and energetic individuals—so we’re serious about a healthy life-work balance and a comfortable, casual environment.
