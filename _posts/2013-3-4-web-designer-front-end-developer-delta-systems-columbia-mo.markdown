You will be responsible for designing and developing websites and user interfaces for web-based applications. Strong creative and design sense, ability work efficiently in a team, and ability to communicate directly with the client are key. You will be expected to read and interpret client design briefs, translate their ideas into complete website mock-ups, and cut and code those designs into static HTML/CSS templates. Anything you can do beyond that is gravy. And we love gravy.

The ideal candidate will have real passion for the web and always keeps an eye on emerging technologies. You will be working closely in a team of highly skilled web developers that are scattered across the United States. If you can design it, they can make it a reality.

* Bachelor’s degree in something (if it’s something related to graphic/interactive design, even better!)
* Proven experience designing for client needs
* Strong understanding of HTML/CSS
* Strong understanding of User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX) principles
* Excellent written & verbal communication skills
* Understand and practice web standards
* Ability to work on multiple projects is essential

##Bonus Points:

* Experience working with a modern CMS
* Experience templating for WordPress is a huge plus
* Experience with JavaScript / jQuery / YUI
* Strong understanding of HTML5/CSS3
* Experience with PHP would be nice, but not expected
* You know your way around Basecamp
* You are used to keeping detailed, client-friendly time records
* You have a dribbble.com account
* You have a GitHub account

 
##Work Environment:

Since 1986, Delta has been building tracking systems for everything from napkins to insurance policies, from golf courses to hot dog ingredients, from horse ailments to yoga certifications, and from blood donors to paddlefish.
Building online applications and data management systems that are intuitive yet powerful is our specialty.
