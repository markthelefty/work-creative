If you are a motivated, hard worker and you’re excited to be an integral part of a new and innovative start up, we want to hear from you!

Plink is a new online to offline rewards program that motivates our members through online media channels to shop and dine offline. We have currently signed on some of the nation’s largest brands (including Burger King, Taco Bell, Arby’s, 7-Eleven, Outback Steakhouse and more) to our program and we’re excited to bring on more.  We are building a cutting edge, disruptive platform that bridges the gap between online media and offline sales. Recently we were selected by Business Insider as one of the top 8 start-ups of 2012.
