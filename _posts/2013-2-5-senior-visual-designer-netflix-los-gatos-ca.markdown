Are you constantly thinking about how social interaction could push the experience of the products you use? Are you passionate about creating clean, scalable designs that reveal the human element?

We need visual idea generators; designers that want to connect our members to their friends, and to our content.    

##About You:

You’re truly talented—recognized among your peers as the best. Your portfolio inspires and impresses other designers. Frankly, it also makes them a little jealous.
 
You’re an innovator by nature. You “think” AND “do”. You’re smart, confident, highly competent—and mature enough not to have an ego. You’re a skilled communicator who welcomes honest, candid feedback. You believe that the best designs prove themselves in the marketplace, and you think of data and testing as allies in creating the best possible user experience.
 
You have exceptional visual skills, and impeccable sensibility for color, composition, form and story. You’re a genius at solving interactive problems—and you’re passionate about exploring new frontiers in web, TV and mobile interface design.

Now is an especially exciting time to join our design team as we think about how to take the social experience around movies and TV and move it into the future. If you’re ready to add your vision—to imagine an alternate future—this is a rare opportunity. The things you discover and create will have widespread impact.
 
##About Us:

This is a place where talented, curious people come together to share ideas and solutions. Although Netflix is an established company, in many ways we still act like a start up, allowing us to act quickly on emerging business opportunities.
 
When we find the right people, we value them deeply—our compensation, benefits, and culture are hard to beat. We also believe creativity comes from happy, fearless and energetic individuals—so we’re serious about a healthy life-work balance and a comfortable, casual environment.
 
##The Must Haves:

* 5+ years design on consumer-friendly interactive experiences
* A great portfolio that showcases deep visual and interaction design skills
* A keen understanding of social design language and patterns
* Ability to rapidly produce multiple UX/UI concepts
* The communication skills to clearly articulate your concepts—and evangelize on their behalf
* Experience across the entire product lifecycle, living through multiple launches (experience with international launches is a plus)
* BA/BS in fine arts, graphic arts, human factors or related field
* A good sense of humor
* A love of movies and TV shows
