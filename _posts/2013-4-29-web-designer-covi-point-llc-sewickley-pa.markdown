The primary responsibility of this position will be to design the web interface for our micro-scheduling product. The designer will also contribute to the design of the Android and iOS apps, particularly in the generation of image assets such as icons, and logos. Familiarity with modern CSS and HTML will be useful but not required. In particular, basic CSS or HTML editing would facilitate direct modifications and experimentations with the web client prototype.

The website is intended for business-to-business daily use. As such, we are willing to put a premium on quality design and user experience over legacy portability. Support for legacy browsers will not be a priority. Users will be expected to use a major browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or IE) no more than one major version behind. The site will also require that JavaScript be enabled at all times.

From a design perspective, the challenging aspects of our application center around the real-time, data-driven nature of our micro-scheduling system. The website is an AJAX powered, single page application so full page reloads will not occur. Experience with animation and dynamic layout design will be preferred. The job description is subject to change by the employer as the needs of the employer and requirements of the job change.

* Prior web design experience
* Sample design portfolio
* Proficiency in image asset generation and export
* CSS familiarity (optional)
* HTML familiarity (optional)
* Animation design experience (optional)
* Dynamic layout design experience (optional)
