You'll be responsible for all phases of user experience design, from concept to iterative improvements, ensuring that design and interaction blend with business, customer and technical requirements into a crescendo of your design brilliance. In short, you must be legally authorized to kick some design ass.

You are a creative individual with great problem-solving skills and a passionate attention to detail. You wield Photoshop (or Illustrator or Fireworks) like Tiger Woods wields a 9-iron: generating lots of options and getting the design to lay down in just the right spot.
