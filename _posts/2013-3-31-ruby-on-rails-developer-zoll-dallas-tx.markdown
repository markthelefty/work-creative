What's the difference between this job and being a super hero? Both involve saving lives, but we actually pay you.

We are the leader for management and training of life saving devices such as defibrillators. We have the resources and stability of a large company, but the nimbleness, ambition, and determination of a startup, because we used to be one. 

We have a small, highly motivated team and the most important thing is to be a demonstrated self-starter.

##Duties:	
###What we have to offer you:
* Did I mention super hero? Our office is casual enough you could wear a super hero costume, although shorts and flip flops may be more appropriate.
* Intellectually engaging discussions about software architecture among self-proclaimed experts.
* Appreciation that the work you do makes us a better company (mostly in the form of a competitive salary and benefits, but could also include cookies).
* We mean what we say - We're on Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies for three consecutive years.
* Stability - We're on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.

##Qualifications:	 
###What we are looking for from you:
* Super hero like ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at you
* Ruby on Rails coding skills that would make DHH proud
* Nearly insatiable appetite to solve difficult problems fast, which may mean the fewest CPU cycles or developer cycles
* Ok, and maybe some technical prowess with Git/Github, TDD, Postgres, OSX, Linux
* Web design/front-end skills are a big plus - particularly standards-based clean, maintainable markup
* A sense of humor, because really, shouldn't this all be fun?
