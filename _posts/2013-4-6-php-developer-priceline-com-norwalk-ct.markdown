At priceline.com, the marketing team is looking for a rock solid PHP Web Developer to develop a vast array of applications.

We believe in hiring smart people who love what they do. Do you value craftsmanship? Rock PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript? We want to talk to you.  Ever used node.js?  Can write your own jQuery plugin? All the better. Can write your own Canvas based graphing framework. Apply right away.

We look for well-rounded technologists who thrive in a creative, no-red-tape environment.                                                                                                                                                   You’ll be part of a flat, small, tight-knit team delivering real value to customers, with the ability to respond quickly and see immediate results. We’ve kept the best parts of being an original dot-com start-up--the passion of creating something new every day--and blended it with the perks of a thriving international company.

You will be responsible for developing solutions that power our email and social promotion initiatives. Including but not limited to reporting systems, templating systems, caching algorithms, customer behavior systems.. and so forth..
