Grubwithus is revolutionizing our social networks, taking our online relationships offline. Created by two-friends who wanted to ease the post-college friend-making process, Grubwithus is a site that allows users to meet awesome people over tasting menus at top restaurants.

Join what Paul Graham and WIRED have called “A square on the periodic table – a company that seems almost organically preordained, like Twitter and Facebook.” With 12 cities currently in operation and several more planned for the U.S., Grubwithus is an exciting and rapidly growing startup with a bright future.
