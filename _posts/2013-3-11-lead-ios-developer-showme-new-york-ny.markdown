An iOS developer with experience building beautiful, robust, and innovative apps. You must be not only technically proficient but also have a strong eye for UI design.

##ABOUT US

ShowMe was started by a couple guys who wanted to change the way people learn. Today we have hundreds of thousands of users, and have received funding from an amazing group of investors (TechCrunch coverage).

We work at General Assembly, the heart of the NYC startup scene, where we interact with entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and other awesome people on a daily basis.

##SUMMARY

ShowMe's iPad app has received tons of praise for its design and innovative functionality. But we're just getting started. The next phase of our app development will marry content production with content discovery, while further simplifying user experience. If you're up for the challenge, send us the following:

* Examples of projects you've worked on
* Cover letter
* Resume

Compensation is extremely competitive, and includes weekly happy hour drinks and the occasional free lunch. If you’re not in NYC, we’re willing to help get you out here.
