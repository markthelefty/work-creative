##Requirements:

###You are:

A Graphic Designer at Content Studio at 360i. You transform creative vision into eye-popping on and off-line digital experiences for our diverse range of clients. You see opportunity in every project, whether a chance to show off your skills or an invitation to learn new ones. You don't hold back and you don't shut down. New directions and new ideas are what motivate you, flawless execution is what satisfies you. You're clever, efficient, and something else that people can't quite put their finger on, but whatever it is... it's awesome and it needs to create cool stuff.

###You will:
* Work closely with Creative/Design/Art Directors and Copy Writers to compose engaging online experiences, digital advertising, social content and internal promotional/sales material.
* Articulate and defend creative decisions, take feedback and push beyond expectations.
* Research, demonstrate and report on new tools, trends and techniques that can help expand the capability, creativity and expertise of you and the 360i:Recess team.
* Explore opportunities and ideas to bring digital into the physical world.
* Create and uphold the highest standards of quality, efficiency and organization with regard to creative execution, production and file/asset management.
* Help foster a culture of ideas, experimentation and collaboration.

###You must have or be:
* Passion: Your significant-other thinks you have A.D.D. (and you might), because the ideas never stop.
* Wisdom: You have a solid grasp of complex design principles including grid systems, typography, color etc. and can explain them to those that don't.
* Curiosity: You're addicted to knowledge and inspiration and you're always looking for the next fix.
* Fast and flexible: Because getting through the stuff we HAVE to, lets us focus on the stuff we WANT to.
* Weapons Expertise: You have a masterful knowledge of creative software and a true understanding of its place within the arsenal. You also know what a pencil is, and aren't afraid to use it!
* MacGyver: You can solve problems with whatever you have on hand. A font or a color swatch is really all you need to stay "on-brand".
* Mechanical Ability: You love figuring out how things work and fixing them when they don't because its the key to making them better.
* Organization: You understand that the only way to a balance your A.D.D. is with a healthy dose of O.C.D.
* Confident: You can speak and write but usually don't need to because your work does most of the talking.
* Personality: A strong sense of humor is an absolute must. Seriously. We're not kidding.
* Independent: Be able to work independently and in a team environment.
* Chops: A kick-ass portfolio that embodies all of the above and says "You're stupid if you don't hire me!"
* A Hobby: You absolutely MUST do something interesting that helps define who you are outside of the office. Sports, Music, Woodworking, Metalworking, Knitting, Cooking, Wine Making ANYTHING! 

###It would be nice if you can:
* Illustrate in 2 and/or 3D
* Animate
* Shoot/edit video
* Take amazing photographs
