##Company Overview

At merlinmobilityTM, we use Augmented Reality (AR), to deliver technical instructions to iOS and Android devices. Equipment, devices or parts are viewed "live" through the camera of a mobile device. While viewing, a transparent layer appears, providing step-by-step instructions.

Studies demonstrate that 82% of learners struggle making the mental jump from traditional instructions to the physical object they are working on. merlinmobilityTM eliminates this hurdle by displaying instructions in situ, or "directly over" the subject matter.
