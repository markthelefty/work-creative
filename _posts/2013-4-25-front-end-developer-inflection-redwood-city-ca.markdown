Inflection is on the hunt for a passionate Front End Developer that lives on the edge of technology and design! If you’re excited by the idea of building great features on a fast paced agile team, creating applications that will be used by tens of millions of users a month, and working with over 14 billion records (AKA, “big data”), we’d love to hear from you!
 
##You've got moxie.

* You love building websites using emerging technologies
* You keep up with all the latest Javascript libraries and exciting developments within the Javascript community
* You're best at crafting HTML/CSS code, but have an aesthetic eye for design
* You thrive on testing new ideas across millions of users
* You're not afraid to work with some of the most skilled engineers in the Silicon Valley
* You believe the work day should be dynamic, ever-evolving, and filled with free food

##You're flexible (mentally--we have a yoga-free interview process).

* You’re excited about bringing the worlds of engineering and design together
* Your eye for detail ensures our sites stay pretty, clean, and well maintained
* You like seeing features come to fruition and are able to jump into a project at any point in its lifecycle
* You thrive within our data-driven design culture, and can quickly react to changes and new feature requirements driven by our user analytics
* You're hip to the latest requirements for cross-browser compatibility and page optimization

##You know your stuff:

* Very familiar with HTML5 and care about the semantic cleanliness of your markup.
* Confident with CSS and Sass with the ability to leverage new features via progressive enhancement; creating reusable selectors puts a smile on your face
* Strong with Javascript and excited about libraries such as jQuery, Backbone and Require
* You love implementing responsive design and bring a mobile-first approach to your code
* You’ve worked with some form of version management system
* Intuitive and excellent visual eye
* You know your browsers and the limitations and abilities of each
 
##Brownie Points!

* Robust portfolio with up-to-date code samples
* You’ve worked with XSLT
* You love working with dual Thunderbolt display monitors
* You love contributing to the vision of your product
* You enjoy working in an agile environment

##You believe that work and fun can, in fact, coexist:

Bored employees make boring products. At Inflection, there's no such thing. We run big websites with millions of users, but we're allergic to the sterile and cold corporate culture. Work and life should definitely be buddies, so we're serious about cultivating a fab work environment. To wit:

* Conveniently located off 101 in Redwood Shores, with free Caltrain access through company sponsored GO Pass and a shuttle from both Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain stations
* Business goals celebrated with Major Milestone Trips and frequent Friday Happy Hours
* Company sponsored catered lunch daily
* A start up's pantry of complimentary beverages and snacks
* Company subsidized gym membership at nearby Pacific Athletic Club
* High energy team with great mix of experienced entrepreneurs, talented engineers, and successful Silicon Valley veterans
* Culture of acting with integrity
* Competitive compensation including equity options
* Comprehensive benefits package including medical/dental coverage, 401K, and life insurance
