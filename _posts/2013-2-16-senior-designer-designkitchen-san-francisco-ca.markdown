It’s not that you draw on everything – let’s just say that your friends know to keep napkins away from you when you’re out and about and that they have to wear long sleeves to keep your ever-handy Sharpies at bay. You’ve got the eye, though, and why should you stop? It makes you happier than anything to bring an idea to life. And that’s why we’ve got a blank canvas here at Designkitchen for you to scribble away on.
 
As Senior Designer, you’ll consistently generate presentation-grade work with minimal direction, owing to your intimate knowledge of the client’s business motives and requirements as well as your uncompromising attention to detail. What’s more, we’ll expect you to take the lead in many creative projects, mentoring other designers, photographers, illustrators, writers, and vendors as the team moves towards innovative solutions for a diverse array of clients. For this reason, you must have excellent collaborative and multitasking abilities.
 
You’ll present work directly to clients, so brush up on those communication skills. An expert in design software, you’ll also be expected to know your way around HTML/dHTML, CMS, CSS, Audio/Video and Flash within all web, mobile and tablet applications. At the top of our design team, we’ll need you to stay sharp on trends and take the initiative to wow our clients with your napkin doodling.
