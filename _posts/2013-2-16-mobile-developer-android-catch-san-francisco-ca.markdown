Catch.com is the leading developer of note-taking and geo-tagging apps in the Google Android Market with over 7 million active installs on Android powered smartphones. Our apps also work on iPad, iPhone, and the web. Catch.com makes it easy to capture and tag notes, places, photos, voice and other information and save it securely online.

We’re looking for someone who has been building user-facing applications (desktop, web, and/or mobile) for at least five years and has been writing Android apps for at least a year. As a startup, we value people who can work on their own to get something done and out the door quickly. But we also want developers who know when to slow down, get input from other people on the team, and make sure that what they're building today will accelerate what we need to do tomorrow.

##You’ll get a gold star and a commemorative calendar if you:

* Know how to implement and use Android Intent-based services
* Are comfortable with hybrid online/offline designs
* Implement background tasks that don’t suck battery life
* Efficiently query and manage large data sets on mobile devices
* Understand the Android UI guidelines but aren't limited by them
* Have something to say about security, both on-device and off-device
* Can talk knowledgeably about structured and unstructured data and how people interact with such data.
* Have done work with iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, or other mobile platforms in addition to Android.

In your cover letter, please tell us about one mobile app that you really admire and one thing you think that app should have done differently.
