##Wanted:

A talented designer who can distill wildly complicated problems into simple and elegant solutions.

##Your role:

Agile Diagnosis is looking for a talented UX designer to join our team. You will join passionate entrepreneurs tackling some of the most complex challenges facing our health care system. Agile Diagnosis is a place where you are free to produce the best work of your career, see your work in the hands of tens of thousands of doctors, and improve care for millions of patients in the process.

We are a young, nimble company. You will design core flows and work with users starting day 1. You will contribute to product design, marketing and engineering discussions, so bring your best ideas. You will build something that you are proud of.

##Requirements:

* You are self-aware, self-motivated, and self-disciplined
* You are highly empathetic to a user’s emotions and needs
* You care deeply about usability and understand what makes an experience good or bad
* You can think through user problems, find good solutions, then mock them up in detail and help engineers build them
* You are obsessive over detail, and polish your work to be pixel-perfect
* You are a team player who can accept feedback and constructive criticism
* You have a strong portfolio of implemented designs, prototypes, interaction flow mock-ups, wireframes, and sketches
* You are proficient with the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and other prototyping or wireframing software

##Ideally:

* Startup or other professional experience is great, but not required
* Able to prototype your designs in HTML and CSS
* Experience conducting user research—ranging from insight development to usability
* Mobile design experience
* Expertise in developing information architecture, interaction models, user flows, and wireframes for complex products, services and interactions

##What we offer:

* Competitive salary
* Stock options
* Employer-paid health care
* Unlimited personal-time off; enjoy vacation days whenever you want, as long as you're getting things done
* We'll outfit you with the workstation and all the tools you need
* Free drinks & snacks at the office
* An opportunity to solve design problems that have never been solved before, and improve the lives and well-being of people around the world
