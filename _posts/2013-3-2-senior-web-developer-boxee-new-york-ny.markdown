We're hard at work building the next generation of products at Boxee.  Our new platform will target many different devices using diverse technologies.  Users will soon be able to experience Boxee on mobile, tablet, web and of course Boxee Box. It's a very interesting environment to work in for an engineer.  There's always something new to learn

Some stuff we're using in our web stack: ruby, rails, node.js, mongodb, mysql, redis, ember.js, jquery and php

We believe in hiring smart, creative and passionate developers.  Our interview process is friendly and casual but in-depth, we're looking for the best and brightest.

Do you have experience scaling products quickly, building beautiful user experiences, processing lots of bits or other relevant experience?  We'd love to hear from you.
