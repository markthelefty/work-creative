##About Us:

At SweetLabs we build products that empower developers to offer users a richer and more compelling application experience. Today, we do that through two unique platforms: Pokki, a powerful platform that brings media-rich web applications directly to the desktop; and the OpenCandy Software Network, which offers user-friendly software recommendations through the download and installation process. Our ultimate goal is to help developers deliver useful, entertaining and informative applications to consumers across any device.
 
The team behind SweetLabs is a smart, pragmatic and experienced group united by a shared desire to improve the software discovery process and user experience for everyone. We work in a casual but fast-paced environment with flexible schedules, full health benefits, 401k and free lottery tickets (or as we call them, stock options). Our investors include Google Ventures, Intel Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners and Oâ€™Reilly AlphaTech Ventures.
