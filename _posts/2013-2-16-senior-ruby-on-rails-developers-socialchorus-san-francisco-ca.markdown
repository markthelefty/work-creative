Are you looking for a chance to do agile development? Do you want to immerse yourself in extreme programming using test driven development? Then SocialChorus is for you.

SocialChorus is forming a powerhouse of technology that measures social reach through paid and earned media through influencer distribution. Our technology stack is up to date with current standards.

On to our development practices. We are on Rails 3.2.8 with deployment on Heroku and test driving EVERYTHING with Rspec, Jasmine, and Selenium. Every Monday we have an internal planning meeting that includes the dev team along with our project manager to go over upcoming features, stories that need discussion, and story estimation (Pivotal Tracker). Mornings start with stand-ups to go over the previous day's work, work for the current day, or any blockers anybody might have. Pair programming and green tests make the day fly by with the gratification of clean code without broken windows. Our analytics module runs in EC2, hitting nginx, aggregating all data into our sharded MongoDB database. Like to map/reduce over extremely large data sets? Sweet.

Great startup environment with a kegerator, ping pong table, Ruby Meetups every 3rd Thursday, Settlers of Catan, Bang!, Dominion, and poker tournaments! Food trucks every wednesday and friday too. Come join our team at: <http://www.socialchorus.com/company/jobs> or email jobs@socialchorus.com
