Evidon is the world's first and largest dedicated provider of privacy and compliance solutions for digital media. The company provides strategy and technology to help leading brands, agencies, publishers, and solution providers comply easily with privacy law and self-regulatory "Ad Choices" programs across North America and Europe. Evidon serves Ad Choices notice on billions of impressions on behalf of these businesses - in the US and in local languages across Europe - giving consumers transparency into and control over how their information is used online. With insights fueled by its popular Ghostery browser extension, Evidon also helps businesses control their audience data. By protecting themselves and empowering consumers, businesses build their brands and improve results.
 

Evidon currently seeks Front End Engineers that are passionate about building killer user experiences. We rely heavily on new tools and technologies like Hadoop, Greenplum, RoR, JQuery, browser extension development (for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer), Puppet, Cherokee, and Flume. Our infrastructure is entirely cloud-based, and our consumer-facing interfaces are viewed by billions of people - in nearly 20 languages -- every month. In this hands-on position, you will be doing soup-to-nuts design, beginning with wireframes, performing some user testing, delivering design assets to developers, and gathering post-release data to evaluate success. Some light engineering skills are desired (such as being able to build and test JQuery plugins into your designs). We are somewhat flexible regarding past experience, and are focused on ensuring a good cultural fit as much as we are in making sure the candidate has the right skills for the job. Candidate should be a driven self-starter who works hard and enthusiastically collaborates with others.
 

This position, based in NY, offers a unique opportunity to work alongside industry thought leaders to create solutions that stem confusion related to online consumer data collection, one of the industry's most pervasive issues.
 
 
##Desired experience:


* Computer Science Degree, or relevant experience
* Ruby on Rails
* Developing creative solutions to gnarly UI challenges
* Comfortable working in Linux and in running and pushing code to AWS/EC2
* Working in an agile environment, with frequent releases and iterative feature development
* JavaScript frameworks like JQuery, Dojo, or Prototype
* Hands-on experience with SQL and databases (we use Postgres and MySQL)
* Mobile site development
* Logical thinking with natural problem solving skills
* Creation of wireframes geared toward specific personas
* Different kinds of user testing (clickable and paper prototypes, A/B testing at scale, etc.)
