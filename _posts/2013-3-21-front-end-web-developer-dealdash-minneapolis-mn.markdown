DealDash's mission is to be the fun & social marketplace for deals. The 4-year-old startup has quickly grown its user base to 1,500,000+ customers. DealDash started as the risk-free, fair & honest alternative to pay-to-bid auction sites and today helps major retailers efficiently move overstock inventory while saving Customers money in a fun & social way. The fact that you can buy the item you were bidding on for its regular price and get a full refund on the bids spent trying to win a great deal differentiates DealDash from the other 'shady' operators in the industry.

Since then DealDash has added patent pending game-mechanics and achieved record social context with more than 1 million Facebook fans. With 1.5 million US shoppers that complete more than 2.000,000 paid transactions / day we are recognized as a leader in our category.
