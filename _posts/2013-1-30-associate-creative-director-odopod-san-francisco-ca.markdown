What is an Odopod Associate Creative Director?
 
##Inspiring Leader
ACDs command every aspect of a project, encouraging team members to seek innovation and perfection. Partnered with a Senior Producer, an ACD co-leads a multi-disciplinary team of Designers and Developers. This leadership is about more than the project itself; it’s about getting the best from each individual so that they are engaged and happy.
 
##Interactive Innovator
ACDs at Odopod are talented designers with the ability to invent thoughtful, viable and unexpected creative solutions. ACDs examine all aspects of a design problem and provide elegant solutions while maintaining a beautiful and usable aesthetic that works for the brand.
 
##Compelling Communicator
ACDs have extensive experience representing the creative team and its work to clients. ACDs must be clear in presenting the team's ideas and work to the client, but also act as the client's most vocal champion to the creative team. ACDs are the catalyst that mixes ideas, pushes concepts, and finds the best way to meet the client's needs with sophisticated design.
 
##Relentless Mentor
ACDs mentor team members to ensure high quality work, across the entire team. They delegate to Art Directors and Senior Designers to take ownership of projects to ensure all objectives are met and that the level of quality is upheld. In a nutshell, they collaborate and mentor in order to create amazing work.
