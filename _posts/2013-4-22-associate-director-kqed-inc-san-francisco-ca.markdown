The Associate Director, Foundation and Government Support is responsible for researching, identifying, soliciting, securing and stewarding philanthropic grants in support of two to three assigned content areas at KQED, with a current focus on KQED News and KQED Education. The Associate Director will raise funds for projects within these content areas across multiple platforms, including public television, radio, and interactive media.

Working closely with the Director, Foundation and Government Support, this position helps to provide leadership to the Foundation and Government Support team, which includes advising and mentoring the Project Supervisor/s, Project Manager/s and Development Associate; and serving as a key liaison with content staff across different departments at KQED.
