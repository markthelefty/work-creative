At MindMixer, we're building massive new features and solutions in an already highly successful product line and we're looking to expand our development family.

## Core skills:
* Web Development
* Responsive Design
* UX Design

The ideal candidate is proficient in the use of html, javascript (preferrably w/ MVC framework exp.), css, and templating/view engines to deliver a user-friendly and responsive experience to users on desktop and mobile devices. In your daily routine, you should also expect to come across or interact with C#, python, json, bson, sql server, and mongodb; experience with or a true excitement to work in those technologies is therefore a quality that will set a candidate apart. Candidates should also be prepared to interact with a number of interesting 3rd party APIs (of various documentation quality).

Do you enjoy a low stress, high fun, high performance environment?

Does the idea of a startup that is already profitable but still has enticing incentive opportunities and profound new market and product opportunities interest you?

MindMixer might be the perfect place for you; we are a small group who espouse a relaxed, work-hard/play-hard culture led by two dynamic founders with a unique vision and a very noble hypothesis: increasing the engagement between individuals in a community and giving them a direct line to community leaders will benefit the community as a whole. Come be a part of that vision!
