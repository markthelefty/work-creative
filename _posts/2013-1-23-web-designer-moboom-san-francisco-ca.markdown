##Description
Moboom is looking for an amazing visual designer to create beautiful and functional responsive web sites. You will work directly with developers and other designers to help realize our client's needs and visions.

You are an experienced visual designer who thinks strategically and can deliver pixel-level detail. You understand how to create a sense of visual consistency which can be applied both to fit with the specific target platform and lend brand consistency across all products and platforms. You are comfortable weaving established visual language and style into new products to create something familiar yet compelling and unique.

As a part of the Client Service team, you report to the Client Services Manager. You are responsible for working with clients. Your workload is determined by the volume of jobs in the production queue and you are expected to manage multiple projects for different clients concurrently. The duration of an individual job averages 2 weeks, though certain tasks may require shorter or longer turn-around depending on complexity.

##Responsibilities:

* Creating designs, mockups and specifications for responsive web solutions.
* Producing pixel-perfect deliverables and assets.
* Communicating your design thinking clearly to the Moboom community.
* Collaborating with interaction designers and engineers to ensure a great user experience from design to implementation.

##Qualifications:

* Strong portfolio of visual design.
* At least two years of professional visual design experience.
* Bachelor's degree in graphic design or related field (or equivalent experience).
* Familiarity with modern web technologies (HTML5/CSS3/Javascript) 
* Ability to rapidly conceive, visualize and iterate design solutions in a collaborative environment.
* Proficient with the tools of the trade (we use Photoshop, Illustrator, OmniGraffle, etc)
* Responsive web design experience a must

##Pluses:

* Multi-disciplinary, always-learning mind set
* Interaction design experience

Moboom is an international company with a global presence. Up to 25% travel will be required.
