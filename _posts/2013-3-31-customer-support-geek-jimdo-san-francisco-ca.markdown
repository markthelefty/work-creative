Jimdo is looking for a customer support geek in our San Francisco office to provide better support for our growing userbase in the US and Canada. You'll join our growing team in San Francisco to help Jimdo users build and and succeed with their websites.

At Jimdo, we give our users an easy-to-use but powerful way to create their own websites. Jimdo's strengths are usability (we have passionate users pushing 70), a high degree of visual flexibility (it's very easy to integrate your own design), and high-quality presentation of photos, videos, and text. Over 8 million users around the world are already building their websites with Jimdo -- and we're continuing to grow exponentially.

Jimdo provides awesome email support to users around the globe in 11 languages. We have a powerful product with a lot of features (online store, blog, and more), and superior customer service is one of the special reasons why people love Jimdo. We want them to feel comfortable using a do-it-yourself product with just email and chat support.

This position is full-time and located in our office in San Francisco.

##What you'll be doing
* Help Jimdo customers efficiently and professionally with all issues related to their websites. This includes domains, email, widgets, SEO, and other best practices
* Create and maintain great tutorials and help articles
* Improve internal workflows and user experience. Collect and share feedback from customers with our team. Help make Jimdo a little better every day!
* You are on a mission to make every Jimdo user happy.

##Requirements
* Web geek, experience with creating and/or maintaining websites/blogs/stores
* Experience in email support
* Experience in chat support a plus
* Very friendly and personable
* Communicate complex problems in customer-friendly language
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Able to think outside of the box and find creative ways to solve customer problems

##Benefits

Working for Jimdo in San Francisco is special since you'll feel like you're at a small startup -- but with a big team behind you. We want everyone who joins Jimdo to visit the office in Hamburg, Germany, about once a year to get to know and work with the European team. You could combine this with a holiday in Europe ;-)

* Competitive salary and benefits
* Three weeks of vacation each year (we expect you to take it!)
* Centrally located office in San Francisco's Mission District
* Several health insurance options
* Vision and dental insurance
