NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.

##NexGen's Gaming Product Details - Desktop (PC & Mac), Web & Mobile (Android & iOS)

We're developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.

The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:

* The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results
* The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program
* Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS
* The database and back-end reporting capability for company support
* Company website portal

We recently demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.

We are a windows shop. However, ff you have an open source background and consider youself the agnostic type with a high stadard for making quality, scalable software, then we'd love to connect with and tell you more details surrounding the greatest technology challenge of your career.

##Funding & The Legalization of Online Poker in California

The company is underway and funded by a well-known and big Native American casino. This is an important point because the proposed law states that in order to run an online poker system you must already hold a gaming license in CA. The tribe will also provide the $35-40M required to obtain the license when the licensing process is available.

The legalization of online poker in California is anticipated to be enacted in 2013 with the ability to open the online poker room either in late 2013 or early 2014. The bill for legalization is known as CA Senate Bill 51 which was introduced by Senator Roderick Wright on Dec 21, 2012. It was first introduced by on 2/24/12 as SB 1463 before being withdrawn several months later.
