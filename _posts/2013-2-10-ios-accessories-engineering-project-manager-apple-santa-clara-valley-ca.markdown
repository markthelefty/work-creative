The iOS Accessories group is looking for an Engineering Project Manager (EPM) to lead the design and development of Apple-branded accessories for iPad, iPod and iPhone - a multi-hundred-million-dollar business that sits alongside the enormous iPad, iPod and iPhone businesses.  

EPMs are responsible for managing and communicating project definition, development milestones, project schedules, and project status in the development of new products. An EPM must be able to prioritize issues and track the details as well as be in touch with the big picture issues. EPMs must be fearless organizers who are ready to work with the highly skilled hardware, software, mechanical design and industrial design teams to identify and resolve potential risks to the schedule and risks to the quality of the product. Success is defined in terms of the quality and timeliness of the pre-production builds and the start of mass production. EPMs need to have a strong understanding of development and manufacturing processes - from part design to circuit board manufacturing to production line bring-up.  

We are looking for someone who is flexible and can respond quickly, energetically, and enthusiastically to changes. Cross-functional communication skills and experience are essential. The EPM will interact with all engineering design disciplines plus safety, reliability, marketing, packaging, manufacturing, component engineering, and other resources inside and outside Apple.

* Maintaining communication within the development team 
* Maintaining project schedules 
* Cross-functional organization, communication, and management 
* Creating meetings and documenting action items and progress 
* Travel to support manufacturing builds 
* Reporting and presenting to senior management on project status and schedules  

###Required Experience: 
* BS ME/EE/CE degree or equivalent. 
* 5+ years in consumer products and/or other product development 
* 2+ years of project management experience 
* Strong technical background 
* Strong track record of shipping products and managing them through the entire product life cycle 
* Experience working with off shore manufacturers and travel to manufacturing sites 
* Strong organizational and management skills 
* Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written  

Some international travel is required, approximately 20%.
