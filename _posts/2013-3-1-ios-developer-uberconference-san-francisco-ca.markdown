ÜberConference took home first prize in the Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Distrupt. A free audio conferencing service with a visual interface, ÜberConference solves the most common problems faced in teleconferencing including making a conference easy to join, knowing who is participating, knowing who is speaking, and making advanced features easy to use. Recent updates include Evernote integration, instant conferences and in-conference chat. ÜberConference is available on the web, with mobile versions coming soon. (This is where you come in)
