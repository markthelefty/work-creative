Are you interested in building products used by at least 20 million people? Rocket Lawyer is seeking a talented and experienced Senior Front End Engineer who is passionate about building web and mobile applications. This position is full-time and is based in our San Francisco office.

At Rocket Lawyer, our technology team builds and innovates better ways for people to collaborate and get their legal work done, quickly and affordably. Getting it done right requires coming up with creative solutions, a get-'er-done attitude, and a team that pulls together to build a platform that primes us to scale. Sure, it takes a lot of hard work to power a product used by over 20 million people, but we wouldn't have it any other way. We do high quality, agile development at a fast pace. Put simply: we're a startup, without the startup hype.

So how do we do it? We build things that will help our users, first and foremost. The language and application platform we use for any particular project is the one that gets the job done best, with a bias towards quality open-source technologies. Our platform includes a home-grown document engine and design toolset, a dynamic interview designer and service, rich content design/categorization/management tools, collaboration services and an extensive product catalog and lawyer directory. We work on solving scalability and performance challenges, interfacing with other platforms, crunching big, semi-structured data sets, workflow automation and exposing the ability to configure and compose new services to non-engineers.
