We currently have an excellent opportunity for a Front End Developer Intern in our Santa Clara, CA location.

* Deliver browser compatible front end code to back end developers
* Familiarity with frameworks such as Jquery & Bootstrap
* A passion for collaborating with graphic designers
* Familiarity with SEO
