Come learn and grow with LaunchWare. It’s a great opportunity to improve your coding skills and create awesome applications. This is a full time position. Learn all the coolest, client-side technologies like HTML5, SCSS, BackboneJS, and Jasmine while honing your Rails skills.

Have you ever wanted to contribute to an application that will really help people find what they need? We’ve launched a network for cancer patients and their loved ones so that they can find better care, more support, and connections with others that have similar experience. We’re anticipating heavy traffic volumes and usage as the client has partnered with American Cancer Society. This is truly a fun, rewarding project and an excellent client. There’s some really interesting problems here around matching users with relevant peers, resources, events, and services among many others. We have many other exciting projects to get involved in, and we continue to seek clients that have significant, social, impact in areas like Healthcare and beyond. Come solve their problems with us.

##You will:

* Work in a results only environment. Work where and when you want, as long as the work gets done.
* Learn design patterns and architectural techniques that help web applications scale and change with requirements
* Learn JQuery and Backbone.js along with other exciting client side technologies
* Learn how to write tests first and implementation second
* Build and maintain Rails 3 applications
* Learn how to write good user stories, acceptance criteria, and acceptance tests
* Ensure that software delivered is delivered qualitatively
* Write semantic, W3C compliant markup and unobtrusive, object oriented javascript with JQuery and Backbone
* Write well tested and expressive ruby
* Solve interesting problems in the simplest way possible
* Work directly with clients to discover and confirm requirements
* Work with a very small and innovative consulting company that endeavors to delight its clients
* Work directly with the company’s principal and founder, Dan Pickett and a growing team of enthusiastic developers

##What We’re looking for:

* Practical, demonstrated knowledge of web standards and best practices in front end development (HTML5/CSS3, Semantic Markup, Progressive Enhancement, W3C compliance, etc)
* Solid communication skills as indicated from references. You will interface directly with clients on a regular basis.
* A strong, insatiable desire to learn and hone your craft
* A demonstrated understanding of the Rails framework and MVC fundamentals
* Two years experience in the web development field, preferably with interpreted, back-end technologies
* A familiarity with object oriented design and architecture
* Clean, well thought out code


##It would rock if you:

* Have built a few rails applications.
* Have written javascript and understand JQuery.
* The ideal candidate gets excited about learning new things and working with various parts of the Rails stack. Your goals should include establishing yourself as a helpful and integral member of the Web Development community at large. If you don’t want to build and share your knowledge, this is not the gig for you.

Resumes are great, but practical application and endorsements from your peers, employers or clients will secure the position.

Most work can be done remotely, but we find pairing and collaboration to be most effective when we’re physically working alongside each another.

In the next year, we plan to continue building great applications for our clients. We’re also building training programs, publications, and our own products as well. Come help shape the vision.

It’s truly an opportunity to get involved in some great projects and learn a lot. We hope to hear from you!
