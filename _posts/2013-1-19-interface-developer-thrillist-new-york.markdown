##Overview:
Thrillist, JackThreads, and our newest family member, The Crosby Press, are scaling rapidly and building a team of hardcore programmers to match our lofty ambitions. Each weekday, we drop our subscribers a must-have recommendation, from the best of what's new, to deeply under-the-radar goodness, and supplement this with lots of killer web-only content. We are looking for a Front End Developer to help us develop cutting edge features to get this content to our readers in the most beautiful and efficient way possible. You will be responsible for defining the in-house standards and developing the client-facing tech that powers the next generation of a content-driven website.
 
##About Thrillist Tech:

We are a small collection of avid developers who work across three different platforms to reach our millions of users. From front-end to back-end, QA to devops, every member of our team is as passionate about their work as they are talented. Our developers are fastidious about code quality, but know when to be pragmatic and just get stuff done. We also encourage everyone to never be pigeonholed into one discipline - we love to learn from one another as much as possible.
Responsibilities:
About you:
 
We’re looking for the right person who has an eye to take our awesome design teams' comps and make them sing. You should love to work hard, because you know how great it feels to say, "Yeah, I built that.". You follow all of your favorite projects on Github and know exactly where they would fit in within a project you are working on. You are obsessed about page-load speed, and love talking about minification, asset compression, and browser memory usage. In fact, you have probably opinions on lots of nerdy front-end topics. Underscore or JQuery? Favorite new feature in EMCAScript 6? We want to hear.
 
##Qualifications:
Think you have what it takes? This is what we're looking for: 

 
A strong understanding of JavaScript and jQuery. If you know another library, that's cool... you'll just need to prove it. 
Expert understanding of CSS and HTML. You know how to build towards cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility. (Except for IE6. We're not cruel, after all.) 
A passion for front-end development, and beautiful, concise, organized code. We want you to own the front-end domain, knowing where and when to use a library (or write your own!). 

##This would make you a better candidate:   
Experience developing mobile-friendly, responsive sites
Know how to use Git and GitHub 
Knowledge of one or more compiled-CSS languages
Knowledge on one or more of some recent Javascript-based technologies: Handlebars, Coffeescript, Backbone, node.js, etc.
 
##Technologies we use and love:
* PHP
* JQuery
* Ruby
* Handlebars
* SASS
* Coffeescript
* MongoDB
 
 
We expect a ton out of our team, and because of that, we want to make sure you’re as happy as can be. We have team lunches, dual monitors and brand new Macbook Pros. Plus, a pretty great view of lower Manhattan. We embrace the NYC tech community and often host self organized tech classes with our colleagues and our peers. (Do you have a specific tech skill you are passionate about? We want you to teach it to us!) We make sure to keep our coffee machines brewing all day and have the usual nerd toys. Don’t forget the normal benefits, too: competitive salary, health and dental insurance, sick days, vacation days and as you spend more time with our team, flexible work hours and work place. Naturally working at Thrillist means you get access to some pretty cool Thrillist events and occasional product (booze) presentations right in our office. 
 
**Candidates MUST be available to work from our offices in Soho, NYC.**
No offshore or remote (sorry).
