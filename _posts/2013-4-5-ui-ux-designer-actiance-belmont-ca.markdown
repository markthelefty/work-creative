What legacy are you leaving behind?  Are your designs getting lost among the many websites and tools that are accessed by only a limited group of users?  Are you ready to start a legacy by designing a social enterprise tool that is reaching thousands and thousands of end users each day?  Do you want your work to be proudly displayed and used by our top-notch clients - highly visible professionals from across all industries? Then you may be ready to join the Actiance Design Team! 

##You are ready to join if:

* You are a forward thinker, ready at a moment's notice to brainstorm creative solutions to share with a team as excited as you are to solve challenges. You doodle on anything you can get your hands on!
* You love to talk through ideas and collaborate, and you aren't afraid to challenge the status quo.  Think your manager or the VP of Product Management or CEO is wrong?  Then tell us - that's part of your success!
* You are an expert on social and Web 2.0 design, and your portfolio proves it.  Not only that, but you also think about progressive enhancements such as mobile layouts and always asks 'what's next?'

##The technical aspect:
* You are a superb prototyper, using HTML 5, CSS 3, Adobe tools, storyboards, process flow diagrams - it doesn't matter as long as you can communicate your ideas! 
* You will own user experience testing - from developing scenarios and questions for a target audience to collecting, analyzing, and presenting outcomes to Product Management, Engineering, and the Executive Team.
* Since our team is fast moving, you would be considered a ROCK-STAR if you could then code your ideas using jquery so that Engineering gets your design just right.  This would tip the scale and guarantee you a chat with our hiring team.

##What you'll be doing:
Since our business is growing - too rapidly, we think - we need bold thinkers who will challenge the status quo and use their creativity to launch our product into full maturity.  Your initial goals will be to come up with a plan of attack on how to improve our current products.  You will also call the shots and formalize our design process to improve and establish guidelines.  This is a great opportunity for someone looking for the chance to take a product that is in early stages and be a key contributor to designing the framework from the ground up.  You will have a lot of creativity to contribute and you will have the technical skills to carry it out!
