Speck is obsessed with designing cases that are just as smart and indispensable as the gadgets they protect. Founded in 2001 by a group of design engineers, and located in the heart of Silicon Valley, we are captivated by technology, fanatical about our gadgets, and consumed with making products people love. Our focus on what people care about inspires us to craft cases that are a perfect fit. We make cases that don’t just protect phones, MacBooks, ereaders and tablets – they also contain clever details that spark delight in our customers. Speck's line of products can be found at Apple retail stores, AT&T, Verizon, Target, Toys R Us and at speckproducts.com.

We are looking for a well-rounded Web Developer that can design and code.  In this role you will use your HTML, CSS3 and jQuery skills to enhance and polish our eCommerce platform making our shopping experience delightfully unexpected, yet intuitive.  Are you a designer, too?  Can you design layouts without much direction and you bring it to life using Adobe Creative Suite?  Even better!

* You will be relentless in learning, adopting and adapting to bleeding edge technology in order to consistently produce best-in-class work, deploying quality assured, well-tested code to production. Knowledge of and proven experience with agile deployment and rapid application development without compromising quality is strongly preferred.
* Brainstorm, collaborate, design and produce web graphics, online marketing assets and interface design solutions that drive conversions, but also convey our brand message and feel.
* Create webpage wireframes with as little as napkin sketch (and do so quickly, within reason, of course).
* Create beautifully responsive, pixel-prefect layouts that are highly useable and perform well.
* Using your UX and UI skills, create multiple layout experiences for A/B testing.
* Code HTML email newsletters that look great on web and mobile devices.
* Create interesting advertising assets for social, Amazon, ebay, etc.
* Learn new stuff all the time:

** Maybe you will be needed to help create presentations that tell a story with builds and animations
** Maybe you will be asked to create a fun animated GIF
** Maybe you’ll want to learn how to create beautifully rendered cases in 3D Studio Max, Maya, or KeyShot
** Generative Art
 
##About You:
* Experience partnering, liaising, and working with creatives (e.g. designers, copywriters, etc).
* Design skills and strong experience in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Illustrator a plus).
* Solid understanding of content management systems (e.g. Magento).
* The ability to assist with HTML templates for e-mail newsletters. 
* JavaScript and jQuery. Using out-of-the box JS plugins and styling to existing designs.
* The ability to develop and implement maintainable and scalable cross-browser code across large sites.
* Ability to troubleshoot cross-browser compatibility issues with multiple versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and mobile browsers.
* Knowledge of the latest HTML5/CSS3 standards and tricks.
* Demonstrated knowledge, skills and abilities to code and deliver Photoshop designs in HTML/CSS format within tight deadline requirements (sometimes you may just get a JPG and you’ll need to design without specs just to get the ball rolling).
* The ability to quickly create rough, working prototypes.
* A team player to flex between a leader and/or implementation contact as required.
* A perfectionist who makes sure every pixel is in the right place.
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
 
##A Big Plus:

* At least 3 years of related work experience.
