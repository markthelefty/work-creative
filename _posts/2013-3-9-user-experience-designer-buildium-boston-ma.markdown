There may be other UX Designer job descriptions out there, but at Buildium, we have our own idea of what makes a great UX Designer: a detailed thinker who shows a clear understanding of design problems from business, user, and technical perspectives. Someone who cares deeply about delivering high-quality user experiences that are easy to understand, efficient, and representative of the Buildium brand.

They are also fundamentally curious about the way things work, both in the digital and physical world. They realize the value of process and best practices, but are open to exploring new ways of communicating concepts and information.

As a UX Designer at Buildium, you'll collaborate with development, marketing, customer care, and other members of the design team to create amazing user experiences with our web and mobile products.

Buildium is casual, open, collaborative, and noisy at times with a singular focus: building a great company. We eat lunch together, talk about pop culture and current events; and genuinely enjoy each other's company.
   
We don't hire based on a list of buzzwords or acronyms on your resume. We are not only looking for someone who can create solutions that meet the business and technical requirements; we're looking for someone who dreams big about changing the way people interact with technology.

If that's you, apply and link us to your portfolio.
