Social media has dramatically changed the way we share and connect with friends and family, and it will have an even more profound impact on the way companies operate. Yammer and Microsoft provide a secure, private social network for your company. Yammer empowers employees to be more productive and successful by enabling them to collaborate easily, make smarter decisions faster, and self-organize into teams to take on any business challenge. It is a way of working that naturally drives business alignment and agility, reduces cycle times, engages employees and improves relationships with customers and partners.

##The Vision
You know devices are the future; come help us design the future of great work software on Android-powered devices. We're building a product that empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent way of doing their jobs.

The Yammer team is located in San Francisco, and we maintain the intensity, pragmatism, and velocity of a startup. We release product weekly and projects last weeks, not years.

##The Gig
Our team is structured around designers who are flexible, but who specialize in either visual/UI or interaction/UX. Our UI designers translate wireframes into pixel-perfect, typographically beautiful, development-ready visuals. Your visual designs and ideas are an integral part of what makes a feature stick. You'll be part of feature project teams from the beginning until launch, working side-by-side with a product manager, UX designer, researcher, engineering team, and QA.

##Requirements:
* 1-3 years’ experience working, preferably at more than one past company.
* Demonstrated understanding of Android’s User Interface Guidelines through completed design work.
* Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements.
* Ability to negotiate and articulate the "why" of design decisions. You'll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.
* Expertise working daily in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Fireworks.
* Ability to provide visual specification and production ready files to engineers.
* A portfolio online or in PDF format

###The kind of people we're eager to work with are:
* Full of empathy for users
* Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art
* Excited that their designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research
* Enthusiastic and possibly a little bit weird
* Eager to move to a fast-paced environment
