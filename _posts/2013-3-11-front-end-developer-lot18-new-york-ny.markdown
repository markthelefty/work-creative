Lot18 is revolutionizing the way America buys wine.

We're an agile technology startup based in New York City. We connect wineries and retailers with our members nationwide. The wine, glassware, and other epicurean products we offer are highly curated by teams on both coasts.

Lot18 is a great place for smart people who know how to get things done - and who want to work alongside likeminded teammates. Come make a difference.

##Competitive Salaries, Full Benefits

All positions are full time and based in New York, unless otherwise stated, and come with a comprehensive benefits package:

* Stock options
* Competitive salary
* Medical, dental and vision
* Top of the line computer setup
* Fun office environment (foosball, XBOX360, turntables)
* Plenty of wine

##Work With Awesome People

We run the gamut. Our people hail from companies such as Amazon, AOL, AT&T, Christie's auction house, CollegeHumor/IAC, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, Sony Ericsson, Forbes, Gourmet, The French Laundry, The Waverly Inn, Benu, Ruth's Chris Steak House, and many others. Lot18's employees have over 150 years of combined experience in the technology and wine industry.

We've gotten a perfect score on the SAT and graduated from top schools like Harvard, Oxford, and Princeton. But please don't hold it against us! We've done things in the real world, too, like climbing Mt. Everest and sailing the Atlantic Ocean to winemaking, filmmaking for the 48 Hour Film Projects, studying cheese-making in Italy on a Fulbright, making videogames for Aerosmith, and playing with the Philadelphia Orchestra. In our spare time, we like to eat and drink, run marathons and compete in roller derby and dodgeball. 

We are looking for well-rounded front-end developers that will write efficient code, snappy pixel precise interfaces and create an amazing user experience. You'll bring new design perspectives and have an important say in how we design and build our product. You need to think like a user, be able to show the DOM who's boss, be passionate about the front-end and excited to build and iterate on features that will help change the way people buy wine online.
 
##Responsibilities

* Conceptualize, design and implement consumer-facing user interfaces
* Ensure the delivery of a rich user experience
* Write complex JavaScript applications
* Design interfaces that are quick and responsive
* Write tests and participate in code reviews to ensure quality
* Contribute to product and implementation discussions
* Work closely with UI/UX, product and web application teams
 
##Desired Skills

* HTML5 and CSS3 fluency
* JavaScript mastery and experience working with a JS library (jQuery ftw!)
* Experience or willingness to learn an interpreted programming language, like PHP
* Ability to use the Adobe creative suite
* General understanding of version control (we use git)
* A/B and multivariate testing experience
* Write reusable code
* The patience to make things work in Internet Explorer
* Entrepreneurial spirit and a preoccupation with staying on top of industry technology
 
##Why you should come work with us

* Stock options. Medical, dental, vision and cell phone paid in full
* Top of the line computer setup
* 10% time to work on projects outside of your daily responsibilities
* Well funded by top tier venture firms
* Many technical and business challenges to solve
* Plenty of wine to drink and a fun office environment
