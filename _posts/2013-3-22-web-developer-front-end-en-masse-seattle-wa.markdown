If you're good at coding intuitive web interfaces, optimizing the performance of web pages, and working with their underlying architecture, we want to talk to you!

En Masse Entertainment is seeking a Web Developer to extend, refine, and maintain the front-end and back-end aspects of our web presence. This person will work in an open and collaborative environment with friendly, driven professionals, and strive to increase awareness of En Masse and the games we publish.

##Responsibilities

First and foremost, we're looking for someone who can take design mockups and write prototype code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, we're looking for someone who can take those prototypes and carve out the appropriate display logic and business rules in Ruby on Rails.

In addition, we'd like you to contribute as a key stakeholder in designing simple, intuitive, and engaging web pages. UX isn't the main goal of this position however, so you won't be dinged for having a lack of design/UX experience.

To give you an idea of typical tasks, over the last few months, our web developers:

* implemented mockups for a new web store
* applied a new design to an existing site based on a series of high-fidelity mockups by writing HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or templates in Ruby on Rails)
* researched, discussed, and implemented best practices for e-commerce product purchase workflows
* developed a Ruby app (using Sinatra) to utilize a series of API calls for a web storefront
* implemented security patches to site dependencies
* made our automated tests more robust
* wore a wizard hat when they broke the production site
* bragged over their current position on the in-house leveling leaderboard for TERA

If these tasks sound interesting to you, we'd love to see your resume!

##Qualifications

* bachelor's degree in web development or equivalent degree/experience
* experience developing front-end code for websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* experience developing back-end code for websites is a plus (ideally with Ruby and Ruby on Rails)
* familiarity with version control systems, especially Git
* passion for video games, especially MMORPGs

##Fun Factors

* game area and LAN center on site
* free snacks and sodas in the kitchen
* open floor plan where team members collaborate with one another on the fly
* great location in the heart of downtown Seattle. Can you say, “awesome views”?

En Masse employees also enjoy abundant opportunities for professional growth and the potential to learn on the job.

When applying for this position, please include the following items in a compressed (.zip) file:

* resume
* code samples
* portfolio of previous work (if applicable)
* your favorite meme (and brief explanation why)
