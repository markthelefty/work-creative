We're looking for a front-end developer with an entrepreneurial bent to join our team. You'll be crafting new page templates, emails, AJAX requests, user interactions, and rewriting the existing front end to match your high standards. You have free rein to use whatever libs and technology you want for this purpose.

Our development process is hyper agile, with continuous deployment to our development site, and we release new code to production several times a day. Our tech stack is Python using the Django framework and Jinja2 template engine, MySQL (Percona Server), Nginx, hosted on Amazon AWS. All pages are served in under 500 milliseconds... without caching. We're looking for someone who can make our front end just as fast and responsive.

We are a young company, and as such, there's plenty of room for you to grow and take on new responsibility. Our team is built upon mutual respect, autonomy, and a humble awareness and acceptance of our strengths and weaknesses. We're looking for someone to work with us, not for us. 

##Requirements

* You are an HTML/CSS3, Javascript and jQuery ninja
* You've worked with back end engineers before and you know what makes their life easier and how to plan a project with them
* You have a thorough knowledge of cross-browser compatibility issues
* You've got knowledge of cutting edge technologies, but more importantly, the common sense to know when to use them and when to stick with traditional methods
* You're self-motivated, self-directed, and can work without supervision
* You understand that done is better than perfect

##Nice to have

* You've worked with startups and/or small companies 
* You have experience building a mobile site and/or responsive design
* You're familiar with and have an opinion on SASS/LESS, domain sharing, asynchronous loading, icon fonts, sprites, etc.
* You know all the little graceful degradation tricks for the above techniques
* You're obsessed with page load times and seem to always have a waterfall graph open when you're viewing a page
* If you have an interest in taking on product and/or design responsibilities
 
##Application Instructions

* Use the form at right. 
* Please do not include a formal cover letter. Instead please use the cover letter space at right to tell us what you find interesting about weeSpring and provide us three suggestions for improving weeSpring's user experience or design.
