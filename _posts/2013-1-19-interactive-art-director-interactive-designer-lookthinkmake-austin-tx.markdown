Lookthinkmake seeks a full-time interactive art director / interactive designer with a strong aesthetic and a stronger desire to be a part of a fast-growing, award-winning agency that moves at the speed of light. You’re well-versed in web and digital design, including front-end development, UX design, mobile design, and coding—all done with a branded and conceptual approach. You’re no stranger to visual hierarchies, color, typography, logo and identity design. You think first, design second. You play well in a collaborative environment. And you live for, and adapt to, changing deadlines.

You’ll work closely with the Creative Director and the creative team. On any given day you might be working on advertising campaigns, building websites and designing mobile applications, creating interactive banners and emails, designing for social media environments, and developing brand identities. And although you’re a digital maven, you’re not scared of the printed page.

##Applicants must have:
* BA in design, advertising, or related field.
* Prior agency experience.
* Proficiency with Mac OSX and Creative Suite 5, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.
* Strong knowledge of WordPress, HTML, CSS, JQuery/Javascript, PHP.
* Strong organization and communication skills.
* Excellent presentation skills.
* Excellent concepting and brainstorming skills.
* A flexible and self-motivated demeanor.
* The ability to succeed in a deadline-oriented environment.
