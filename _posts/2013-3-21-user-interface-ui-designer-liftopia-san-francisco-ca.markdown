Our products are nothing without easy-to-use and straight-forward interfaces that get out of people's way and help users achieve their goals (in this case, getting out to the slopes!). We're looking to expand our product/design team by adding a designer who believes usability is an important component to badass online experiences.

This role requires a mix of user interface and visual design skills. You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you believe usability & delight goes beyond (but still works closely with) visual aesthetics, this may very well be the perfect role for you.

An online portfolio is required to apply.
 
##REQUIREMENTS
* Experience working on web and/or mobile applications in the consumer space
* Strong design background with expert knowledge of page hierarchy, typography, color theory, and branding
* Demonstrated experience developing and designing: wireframes, mockups, site maps, storyboards, task flows, design specifications, and/or landing pages
* You find little touches of personality in interfaces delightful and make an effort to bring that kind of 'human' feel to your work
* Flexibility in learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas
* Work within, manage and extend design styleguides
* Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.
* Expert in web design tools (ie: Fireworks, Photoshop, llustrator, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Axure, etc.)
* Familiarity with usability testing
* Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches & wireframes
* Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment
* Possess a self-motivated, "git 'er done" work ethic
* 3 years minimum experience designing interfaces that incorporate & extend a brand
 
##PLUSES
* Prototyping code abilities (HTML, CSS, light JS)
* Enterprise user interface design experience
 
##IS LIFTOPIA A GOOD FIT FOR YOU?

Beyond the typical startup/tech industry benefits (like unlimited vacation, health insurance, bonus pool, flexible schedule, stock options, and so on), Liftopia would be a great fit if you identify with any (or all!) of the following:

* You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.
* Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire & effort to grow and remain relevant.
* Company culture - like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days - appeals and is important to you.
* You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you're curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).
* Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.
