The role is a combination of traditional project management and modern digital product design. Working on digital projects requires the ability manage projects that develop applications and digital experiences for the most savvy customers.

The environment is very collaborative, sometimes agile/scrum, and you should have the ability to work well in a mix of designers, UX, developers, strategists, writers and others. Experience or familiarity with agile is a plus but not a must.
 
The role is also very hands-on, so you will need to be able to direct others and produce work yourself. Ultimately, you should have a passion for creating work that redefines the modern expression of a timeless brand.
