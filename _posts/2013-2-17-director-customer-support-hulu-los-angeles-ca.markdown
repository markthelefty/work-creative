The Hulu Support team is dedicated to providing customer support so awesome that it will make users’ heads spin. Seriously. Our goal is to be the absolute best in the world at what we do, and this is a challenge we do not take lightly. We send emails in prose, tweet troubleshooting steps in less than 140 characters, and answer calls so fast users haven’t realized the phone was ringing. We call this “the support we wish we got everywhere else”, and as we go about providing it, we’re looking for a Director of Customer Support to help us take our goals to a new level.

You'll be joining a creative and exciting technology company that is on a strong growth trajectory -- we've been ahead of expectations in all measures of success since our founding in 2007. We pride ourselves on adding people to the team who can perform at a high level while exercising impeccable judgment. You know the type – they are intellectually curious, relentless in their pursuit of better ways, and possess an atypically high attention to detail. We trust them to do the right thing, give them the resources necessary to do so, and try to have some fun along the way.

##RESPONSIBILITIES
 
As the Director of Customer Support, you will be reporting to the VP of Product Development. While you will assume leadership of current day-to-day activities, your mission will be to establish Hulu as the customer support organization others want to replicate. This challenge will involve managing the continued growth of the organization, refining the customer support strategy, scaling to additional locations in the US, and building the tools and processes needed to implement that strategy.

##Other core responsibilities will include:

* Exemplifying the Hulu culture on a daily basis, and fostering it in your team
* Defining and driving the ongoing development of Hulu's customer support strategy
* Focusing on continual improvement of self-help and live-support tools
* Helping each team member grow and develop, while merging individual players into a motivated and passionate team
* Growing the CSA leadership team, and mentoring in core management skills
* Identifying and communicating key feedback trends to Product and Development teams
* Hiring and training the right people to grow a high performing customer support team
* Managing quality of service metrics that ensure a premium-quality customer experience
* 'Leading from the front' by pitching in and responding to customer contacts
* Remaining flexible in your schedule, as we intend to provide 24/7 support in the next year

##QUALIFICATIONS
 
Not just anyone gets to be part of Hulu. We're looking for a proven leader who has developed and motivated people, and shaped strong performing teams. While experience working in media and/or technology companies is helpful, we think it's also valuable to have had exposure to multiple industries. Of course it will help to have experience building and scaling CS teams, but just as important, you must demonstrate rabid passion for customers and an understanding that customer support is really both a form of direct marketing and a valuable source of product feedback. 

* Experience in managing, mentoring and motivating high-performing teams in a constructive manner
* Independence, high energy, and a proven ability to drive results under pressure and in the face of ambiguity
* An analytical mindset and a relentless drive to find innovative ways to improve processes and services
* A solid understanding of web technology and support challenges in the tech industry
* Knowledge of call center operations and best practices, but also the ability to develop a team that can resolve issues without relying on scripts
* Experience with multiple support channels, including an understanding of the scalability and cost effectiveness of web channels
* Experience managing multiple support locations
* A background in marketing and turning customers into brand ambassadors
* A Bachelor's degree.

##QUESTIONS
 
Think you’ve got what it takes? Well, Pop Quiz Hotshot, please take a minute to answer the next two questions, and send them in along with your resume:

##Question 1

Below are brief descriptions of two scenarios someone might have as a customer out in “the real world”. Please choose one of them, put yourself in the shoes of that person, and write a review about what the experience was like (something like a Yelp review). There’s no right or wrong scenario to choose, so don’t spend too much time psychoanalyzing your choice. All we ask is that you keep your response shorter than 500 words.

###Scenario A

**Visiting a new doctor’s office for the first time**

* The receptionist at the front desk was snooty
* You arrived on time, but had to wait 47 minutes until the doctor saw you
* The doctor was super friendly, and had amazing bedside manner
* The only available parking garage cost $15 per hour
* You were promised test results by the next day, but never received them

###Scenario B

**Checking out the brand new restaurant on the block**

* You walked in at 7PM on a Friday night, and were quoted a 45 minute wait
* The host was super friendly and apologetic for the long delay
* After 5 minutes, the manager found you outside to let you know a table had opened up
* During your meal, the server delivered the wrong drink order (twice)
* When the check came, you noticed the drinks had been taken off the bill

##Question 2
OK, now picture this. You’re managing a team of CSAs, but decide to jump in the queue to stay current on customer contacts. Please write what you would consider to be the ideal response to the following customer's questions. Basically, rock their world like you’d expect your team to...

Hi Hulu,
I recently became a Hulu Plus subscriber but I have two quick questions. First, even though I'm paying, why am I still seeing commercials that stutter? Secondly, will I be able to watch all the episodes of The Big Bang Theory and The Office on my TV and iPhone at the same time with Hulu Plus?
Thanks for your help!
