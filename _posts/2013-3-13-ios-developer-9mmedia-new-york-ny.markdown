Love what you do? So do we, which is why 9mmedia has been building amazing things for over 10 years now. We mostly work with startups, and our culture mostly resembles a startup - well, only the good parts, that is. We are a group of 20ish passionate, smart, nice, fun people who all love working together in our gorgeous NYC office. We’ve worked hard to create an inspiring space and culture that combines the best of both worlds - the interesting technological challenges and excitement of a startup, and the stability and comfort of a lifestyle business. 

Our clients are our partners, so if you like being an integral part of developing and starting businesses, you’ll love how we operate. We have a small handful of projects going at any given time, and you’ll get the opportunity to work on many projects over the years, each with its own unique challenges. 

If all that sounds good, we’d love to hear from you! We believe in giving all developers a lot of responsibility and control over what they do, and in treating people with trust and respect. We have no middle management, and you can make your own hours - and no, that isn’t code for us expecting you to be in the office 24/7. We only care about people who can work hard, produce great apps, and get things done. You’ll get to learn lots of new technology, enhance your skills, and have a ton of influence over every product you touch here. We are looking for the sort of person who will speak up to help improve not only our products, but also our process, our technology and our company.
