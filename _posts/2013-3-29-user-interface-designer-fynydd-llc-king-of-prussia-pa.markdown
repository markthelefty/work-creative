Fynydd is looking for an experienced freelance user interface design specialist. This position would have the potential of becoming a full-time position, but at the moment we're looking to augment our staff on a part-time basis. Applicants should have a portfolio of work which contains web application design (mobile, tablet, desktop), as well as mobile software design.

We're looking for top-tier talent capable of producing jaw-dropping user interfaces. This designer should be able to work independently to determine needs based on a task assessment, as well as determine the desired image and overall aesthetic for the project. They should also be able to create wireframes, workflows, and design compositions that can be used by software engineers to implement the UI.

If you work independently, have experience, and can blow our minds with the quality of your work, we'd love to talk with you!
