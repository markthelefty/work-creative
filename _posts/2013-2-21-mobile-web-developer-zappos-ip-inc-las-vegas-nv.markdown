Zappos IP, Inc. is looking for a Mobile Web Developer!  

Why join us?  Our unique culture has made Zappos.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries one of FORTUNE’s 100 Best Companies to Work For 5 years straight. Find out why: <http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/best-companies/>

Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all full-time employees, including medical, dental, vision and 401k!
 
And . . . we're hiring like crazy right now and looking for smart, forward-thinking problem solvers to join our world-class and fairly wacky team.

Oh, and one more thing! Cover letters are cool, but do you know what’s even cooler?! Show us who you are with a cover letter VIDEO! You will be able to upload one when applying for this position. (Video cover letters are not required, but if you wanna do one, we wanna see it!)

##Position Summary:

We're looking for highly skilled front-end developers who live and breathe web standards. You will have strong experience with standards-compliant, semantic HTML and CSS, solid knowledge of native JavaScript, DOM scripting and familiarity with JavaScript  frameworks like JQuery, MooTools, etc. We work with a lot of *nix based technologies so experience with shell scripting and GNU tools will be very beneficial, too.

This is a position for someone that is passionate about modern front-end web development and mobile. While we will consider all qualified candidates, this is not a position for back-end developers that happen to know some front-end coding. (We have plenty of other Development positions for you to apply to.)

You'll be working on mobile web specific projects to help take our mobile web platform to the next level. This will require you to work beyond just the front-end and work with server-side frameworks and web server administration. While you're being hired primarily for your front-end skills, you should be comfortable working on a full tech stack. Ability to work with RESTful API's is a must and some experience with the Zappos API (<http://developer.zappos.com/>) is a definite plus.

We're a casual dress, fun, thriving dot-com with a great work environment and plenty of growth in our future. If we've sparked your interest, drop us an email with a cover letter, your resume and a nice portfolio of sites developed and we'll talk. :)

* Working with FreeMarker templates and JSON or XML files to expose data to the front-end
* Interaction with UX team and business users
