The Heroku Web Apps team is dedicated to beautiful, usable, and valuable web apps. We’re highly collaborative, make decisions in minutes, and ship features in hours. We believe in getting customer validation early, verifying with real data, but also running with our gut. The small team includes UI/UX design and product management, but everyone on the team is responsible for the success of our products, including that we’re building the right thing in the first place, and that it’s polished and beautiful when it’s done.

We're seeking a developer with a passion for UI/UX, great HTML/CSS/Javascript skills and that can own the entire stack of a Ruby on Rails app, including ongoing operations and maintenance. The ideal profile combines deep experience in full-stack web development with a strong computer science background. You must be able to demonstrate prior experience on web sites you’re proud to show off for their polished UI, appropriate use of Javascript, and optimized backends.

##You should be passionate about:

* User experience and goal-directed design
* Current Rails/jQuery best practices
* Style, presentation, and design

##You should be very strong on all of the following:

* HTML/CSS – not a web designer, but extremely good at implementing markup
* Javascript – including jQuery and cross-browser compatibility
* Ruby on Rails
* Performance optimization, SQL tuning, caching strategies
* Ability to own projects end-to-end

##Bonus skills:

* Async (e.g. Backbone.js, EventMachine, Node.js)
* HTML5 fanciness (e.g. websockets, canvas)
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS e.g. S3, EC2)
* Having founded your own startup

Attach a resume, but also include something about yourself in your message. Tell us why you love the product, why you want to work at Heroku, why you want this job, and why you’re qualified. Use the resume to back yourself up.

UI samples (or URLs) should be included.

This position does require that you live in, or be willing to relocate to, San Francisco
