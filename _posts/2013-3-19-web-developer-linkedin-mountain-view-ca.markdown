Do you dream in markup? Can you bend uncooperative browsers to your will using only a toothpick, some chewing gum, and a well placed 'position: relative'? As soon as you finish a project, do you step back and think, 'Now, how can I make this better?' We've been waiting for you.

LinkedIn is looking for web developers who are eager to tackle the challenges of a rapidly growing web application with millions of daily visitors. We're looking for developers to help build rich, dynamic client-side interfaces using Javascript, leveraging new technologies like HTML5 and CSS3, to launch fast/scalable products for our 200+ million global users.
 
Check out our Linkedin Labs page which showcases products built on what we call 'inDay' each month.  inDay is an innovation day where LinkedIn employees have no meetings and are encouraged to work on something not already on the roadmap to keep creative juices flowing. Here is a quick video to explain more about inDay: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ny_jFV4dTk
