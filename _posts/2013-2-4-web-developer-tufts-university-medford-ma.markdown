Web Communications, a department under University Relations, uses the web and emerging technologies to engage a diverse audience, including students, prospective students, parents, alumni, faculty, staff, donors and external media, with the Tufts story. To that end, the department is responsible for creating and implementing the university's web communications strategy; managing internal and external online communications channels; and developing content, tools and services for Tufts.edu and related sites.  

Web Communications assumes full editorial and design responsibility for the main web presence, presidential initiatives and key administrative units. This includes the continued development and maintenance of the Tufts.edu home page, upper level and all major links. 

To support a consistent brand and visual identity across the university, the department produces guidelines and templates that can be used for school, division and department websites. Web Communications implements custom and commercial web applications to support university-wide web initiatives and provides best practices and standards to university staff involved in web and social media projects. 

The primary role of the Web Developer is to maintain existing website code, create HTML code from design mockups and develop new interactive features and applications that create an engaging and rich user experience. 

This position works closely with members of the Web Communications team, and occasionally with clients outside the department, to translate business requirements into functionality that is easy to use and enhances our audience's online experience. This role works in tandem with our internal and freelance web design resources to create elegant graphic user interfaces for websites and applications that support their objectives. 

The Web Developer is also responsible for day-to-day maintenance of a set of existing websites and applications that use front-end programming. S/he troubleshoots and tests to ensure sites are accessible in multiple browsers and that all web applications work correctly.

 
The person in this role must be able to juggle multiple priorities, understand the needs of our different audiences, communicate clearly to a non-technical audience, and work within tight timelines.
