      		<h1>Senior Front End Developer (HTML/CSS)</h1>
      		<h6>at <strong>Bigcommerce</strong> in Austin, TX</h6>
      		<p class="job-date-posted">Posted <span class="job-date">1-22-2013</span></p>
      			<ul>
<li>Do you have Killer HTML and CSS skills?</li>
<li>Are you obsessed with being pixel perfect?</li>
<li>Is precision your passion?</li>
<li>Do you get excited talking about frontend frameworks?</li>
<li>Know your way around jQuery and the DOM?</li>
<li>Do you thrive on creating effective and exceptional user interactions?</li>
<li>Have experience working with PHP and different template engines?</li>
</ul>


<p>Bigcommerce is hiring a Front End Gun (HTML/CSS) to be part of a new internal projects team in Austin. The Development team in our US office is growing and this is our first Front End role over here. This role sits between our sales, marketing and billing teams so you will not be working on our core product but instead will be tackling lots of complex and interesting internal projects.</p>

<p>A big point to make about this role is we want developers that really enjoy interacting with sales, marketing and billing people.</p>

<p>You’ll also work closely with our dedicated team of engineers and designers in Sydney to help us improve our industry leading software used by millions of people every day. Your knowledge of current web standards is second to none, and you know way more about web browser idiosyncrasies than you’re willing to admit! You’ll work across the full BigCommerce application stack, with a focus around the presentation layer.</p>

<p>We’ve got some incredibly challenging projects coming in 2013, so we’re looking for someone with a genuine passion for Front End development.</p>

<h2>Here&rsquo;s why you will love working here:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You will work on large scale engineering challenges that impact millions of people.</li>
<li>Great work atmosphere surrounded by like-minded individuals.</li>
<li>All-day access to our kitchen and fridge, stocked full of good stuff.</li>
<li>Poker tournaments (with craft beers!) every Friday afternoon.</li>
<li>Regular outings to celebrate milestones and achievements.</li>
<li>We are an international success story but we’re a 100% Aussie company.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Who is BigCommerce?</h2>

<p>We are an Australian company with an engineering office in Sydney and a larger sales, support and marketing office in Austin. Our SaaS e-commerce product (launched in 2009) is growing explosively. We have been profitable since day one so when we decided to raise $35m to help us build our team it was on our terms as a true partnership. Our investors are not trying to prep us for a quick flip to some software graveyard. They are actively involved in our business and really helping us cement our position as the fastest growing SaaS e-commerce platform in the world.</p>

<h2>What are we like?</h2>

<p>We are not a startup sweat shop. Our office is largely empty by 6pm. We work smart not hard. We have lots of free snacks. We know exactly what we are looking for in every person we hire. We are really, really good at finding and attracting amazing people to join our team. Our management team is 100% behind our dev team and do amazing things to keep us happy, healthy, engaged and productive.</p>

<h2>Our team:</h2>

<p>We have a 60 person software engineering, design and product team based in Sydney and 90 sales, support and marketing people in Austin, Texas. Most of our Software Engineering team are PHP developers but we also do projects in Rails, Clojure or whatever is the best tool for the job. We have made a serious effort to hire UI, visual design, interaction design, testers and product management people as early as we can so you can focus on pure development.</p>

<h3>Warren Washington &ndash; Business Integration Project Manager (Austin)</h3>

<p>Warren will be managing most of the larger systems integration projects you will be working on so will be your day-to-day manager in Austin. Warren is an exceptional project manager with many years of experience so is well aware of the common mistakes project managers make. He is very good at identifying the resources and skills needed to complete a project, uses a repeatable process for all projects that is process light not process heavy, identifies problems early, and really knows the dependencies between projects. Great guy to work for and spends more time laughing than frowning.</p>

<h3>Soren Harner &ndash; VP of Engineering (Sydney):</h3>

<p>Will be your technical manager. He was previously the VP of Engineering at Atlassian (the Confluence and JIRA guys). He is big on environmental issues, loves riding to work, and has had deep experience building awesome technical teams. We bet you a cookie that Soren is the boss you have always wanted to work for.

<h3>Mitchell Harper &amp; Eddie Machaalani &ndash; Co-Founders (Sydney):</h3>

<p>Our glorious leaders! :P Mitch and Eddie met on IRC and decided to partner up when they realised they were both building similar products. They are not arrogant, they love working with smart people, they are very good at motivating the team, and they won&rsquo;t treat you like a cog in their machine. If you have the desire to one day go out and take a shot at your own startup you will learn a lot from these two.</p>
