&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;About DC Public Schools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our public school students need your expertise, passion and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for highly motivated and skilled talent to join our team at District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). We seek individuals who are passionate about transforming the DC school system and making a significant difference in the lives of public school students, parents, principals, teachers, and central office employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why should you work for Data Systems in the Office of Data and Accountability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom of motion &amp;ndash; Solution developers not code monkeys
DCPS is a highly results oriented organization and the expectation is that you deliver the tools that are needed. How those tools are built is up to you. As we do not have a formal IT department, we are in the unique position of having a lot of interesting problems with no mandate on how we go about solving them. Want to build a data warehouse using punch cards and highly trained guinea pigs? No one&amp;rsquo;s going to stop you here so long as it works how and when it should. We are also not looking for cogs to slot into a machine. If you like munching through a batch of requirements and just mechanically excreting code with no thought to whether those requirements are correct, then this is not the place for you. However if you think at a higher level about process and systems and recognize that a solution has both technical and business process aspects, then you&amp;rsquo;ll find a home here. If you have always wanted to build things the right way, if you are technology agnostic but prefer open-source, and if you understand the power of the 80% solution, then we want to hear from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caliber of your colleagues &amp;ndash; Keeping you intellectually honest
A lot of organizations talk about &amp;ldquo;empowering&amp;rdquo; their staff but there are two basic requirements for that goal. The first is having relevant data and the tools to use/analyze that data appropriately. This is what most organizations focus on when talking empowerment in this context. However, just as critical is the intellectual horsepower and job engagement of the users of those tools. At DCPS in general and ODA in particular you will find your colleagues are of extremely high caliber. Though relatively non-technical, they will keep you on your A game and any inconsistencies or hand-waving will not fly. It is a thoroughly satisfying experience to build quality tools for smart, driven people and that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll find here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mission of the organization &amp;ndash; Making a difference
The mission of DCPS is to educate kids and make sure both that they are given every opportunity possible and that they are prepared to take advantage of those opportunities. There are thousands of dedicated people throughout DCPS working very hard to make that happen. All of them require data or tools of some kind, and your efforts will get magnified through all those thousands of people to effect all 40000+ kids at DCPS. At very few other places will you be able to directly see your day to day work benefiting such a worthy cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the end, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, you will not get rich working for DCPS. We can guarantee you can make much more money in the private sector working for a startup or as a contractor. But we can equally guarantee that you will find your work here deeply satisfying on both a technical and personal level and see the immediate benefit of the fruits of your labor. We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mobile Lead/ Manager- Android at Trulia in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Engineering gets respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the phrase &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo;re a tech company that does Real Estate&amp;rsquo; to emphasize how important engineering is to the company.  Engineering is the department that drives our apps, tools, data, and interfaces forward. This attitude comes not only from the Engineers, but from our CEO and other top management. They believe in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have awesome problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing market provides a fantastic blend of problems.  We need creative people to help us combine the data about every address in America with the soft side of helping people find a home that makes them feel safe, happy, and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re that rare company that holds the culture of its startup roots, while blending in the sanity of a regular work schedule with an emphasis on work/life/family balance. It’s like this because we worked hard to make it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you’ll work on:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be technical lead of the team responsible for all of Trulia’s Android application development. This includes top rated phone and tablet apps in the main Google app store and even a few apps for Kindle. These apps are used by millions of consumers and real estate professionals each day, so the work you do will have huge impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll contribute to Trulia’s awesome, employee-centric team, managing the team of developers who work on the core android experience, and mentoring developers across all teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll join forces with other engineering leads to achieve great things, including coordination projects across all display methods, bottom-up performance changes, enumerating and prioritizing engineering goals, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Who are you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have senior level technical chops, working in a professional coding environment for over five years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been working directly with Android for at least 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand how to manage several apps that are always in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve demonstrated success innovating with Engineering, Product and Design teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy motivating and mentoring talented engineers, helping them navigate tough tradeoffs between functionality, complexity and time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You live to break down and solving complex problems by creating practical, maintainable, and scalable solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a great person that willingly collaborates, listens, and cares about treating people fairly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your work commands a top ranking in the app stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll work with:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently have 3 apps in Google Play and 2 for Kindle Fire. We use the standard Android framework with ActionBarSherlock and Android support library for UI consistency and device accessibility. We start with great user experience, ensure app stability, and focus on performance and code readability. We use ANT with Jenkins for our continuous integration. We release frequently and are working with Robolectric and Android uiautomator for testing. We use Git, and are nurturing a code review culture. We are always looking for new performance tools and optimization techniques to enhance our apps. If there&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for the team, we&amp;rsquo;ll do our best to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How we work:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineering team is about a hundred people, and we break into small teams of 2-4 to focus on specific projects.  We release often, with new features always under development and a strong focus on user experience. Our local QA team writes automation tests and does hand testing of your features, working with you to ensure that only high quality code gets to production. Organizationally, we&amp;rsquo;re pretty flat, though you&amp;rsquo;ll have a mentor with whom you&amp;rsquo;ll have weekly 1-on-1 meetings, to review code, exchange ideas, and ensure we&amp;rsquo;re doing everything we can for you to thrive in your role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other Perks:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Innovation Week&amp;rsquo; every quarter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People you&amp;rsquo;re happy to see every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocked Kitchens and two kegerators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penthouse roof deck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All IDEs welcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeron chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities to work directly with large OEMs and Google developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great benefits (untracked time off, variety of health plans, 401k match)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Web Designer at Covi Point LLC in Sewickley, PA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary responsibility of this position will be to design the web interface for our micro-scheduling product. The designer will also contribute to the design of the Android and iOS apps, particularly in the generation of image assets such as icons, and logos. Familiarity with modern CSS and HTML will be useful but not required. In particular, basic CSS or HTML editing would facilitate direct modifications and experimentations with the web client prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is intended for business-to-business daily use. As such, we are willing to put a premium on quality design and user experience over legacy portability. Support for legacy browsers will not be a priority. Users will be expected to use a major browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or IE) no more than one major version behind. The site will also require that JavaScript be enabled at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a design perspective, the challenging aspects of our application center around the real-time, data-driven nature of our micro-scheduling system. The website is an AJAX powered, single page application so full page reloads will not occur. Experience with animation and dynamic layout design will be preferred. The job description is subject to change by the employer as the needs of the employer and requirements of the job change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior web design experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample design portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in image asset generation and export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS familiarity (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML familiarity (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation design experience (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic layout design experience (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer at Ancestry.com in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for all phases of user experience design, from concept to iterative improvements, ensuring that design and interaction blend with business, customer and technical requirements into a crescendo of your design brilliance. In short, you must be legally authorized to kick some design ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a creative individual with great problem-solving skills and a passionate attention to detail. You wield Photoshop (or Illustrator or Fireworks) like Tiger Woods wields a 9-iron: generating lots of options and getting the design to lay down in just the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Your Wheelhouse:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating taskflows, wireframes, prototypes, annotated mocks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome at synthesizing product requirements, technical constraints, user research and web analytics into efficient user scenarios and design solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love soliciting additional insights by sharing your design work with customers, other designers, and project stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working within and contributing to company design standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to nurture great relationships with coders to ensure that new features are implemented according to your wickedly good specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Our Baseline Needs:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 3 years of relevant industry experience designing for consumer-focused online interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degree in Human Computer Interaction, Graphic Design or related discipline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in the use of design tools to craft great user experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough understanding of interaction/user-centric design and proven visual design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong communication, interpersonal skills working with remote teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latent jet-setter DNA: We have a main office in Utah which you&amp;rsquo;ll visit for 1-2 days every couple months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show us a phenomenal, knock-our-socks-off online portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior Ruby Rails Developer at goBalto in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Who we are&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;goBalto is about re-imagining how study teams get clinical trials started and done. We’re building the modern way to work together; a fast and versatile web application that connects sponsors, CROs and sites with what’s going on, their shared priorities, and who owns each part of the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are software engineering, clinical operations, and thought leaders from companies like Amgen, Genentech, Quintiles, Roche, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, CERN, McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, Intuit, Cisco WebEx, E*TRADE, Peoplesoft and Sun Microsystems. We are backed by Aberdare Ventures, Singapore EDBI, Qualcomm Life Fund of Qualcomm Ventures, West Health Investment Fund, and an experienced team of advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why we’re here&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical study startup process is awful. Existing tools used to track site activation tasks and documents are manual, bloated and complex. To take the next step in clinical study productivity, we need a fresh start. We created goBalto to help take that step; to improve the productivity of sponsors, CROs and sites, to ultimately get medicines to those in need faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you’ll do…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with product management and the engineering team to build functionality in the Tracker application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operate as a member of the goBalto agile development team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair program with other top notch rails engineers, developing across the full stack of functionality from database to front end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build full stack automation tests to ensure that the shipped product is as solid and reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Skills we&amp;rsquo;d like to see&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of 3 – 5 years experience at a senior level with Ruby on Rails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong interpersonal skills in order to help fellow team engineer members with coding/scripting issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrable expertise and recent experience with the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Oriented Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working and deploying on Linux systems (required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with cloud based deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database experience, preferably with PostgreSQL or a similar system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Team attributes&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not just another social app – we’re building a meaningful product with the potential to speed the delivery of new medicines to market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile bones – we promote an agile, test-driven engineering practice that emphasizes team collaboration through pair programming, daily standups, retrospectives, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology you’re already passionate about, and want to do more – we’re using the latest technologies (ruby, rspec, angular) to build solid, well-tested, and beautiful web applications, and challenge our engineers to learn and do more with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What’s in it for you…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become part of a team that is new, energized, and going places…fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow and develop right along with goBalto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a generous compensation package, including benefits from day 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical, dental, vision care, commuter checks and a 401(k).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reap the fruits of stock options as a reward for your energy, contributions, and dedication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A PTO plan that starts accruing the moment you start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in the Financial District close to transportation, dining, wine, and shoe shine stands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, the best part…the opportunity to catch a house set with in-house DJ Robyn, during our Casual Hour Fridays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Sr. Front-End Developer at StackSocial in Venice, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;About StackSocial:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What: StackSocial powers digital commerce across the web with an online marketplace of over 200,000 active members.  Our digital commerce platform provides web publishers a simple and effective way to generate additional revenue by organically weaving flash sales on relevant digital products &amp;amp; tech gear into the reader’s daily experience by channeling the StackSocial storefront directly into each publisher’s site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where: Founded in 2011, StackSocial was accelerated at Amplify.LA and is now headquartered right across from the beach in soulful Venice, California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why: We&amp;rsquo;re changing the way web publishers engage and monetize their audiences.  Publishers hold a captive, passionate fan base; yet most aren&amp;rsquo;t able to engage with their fans via ecommerce, email marketing, and site registration.  StackSocial changes this by enabling publishers to offer sales on hand-picked, trending products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who: We’re a team of entrepreneurs who previously worked at companies like Meebo, Klout, Yahoo!, PopSugar, and our own entrepreneurial ventures. We’re backed by a group of top-tier investors including Draper Associates, 500 Startups, Siemer Ventures, Paige Craig, EchoVC, and others.&lt;/li&gt;

Take product insights and business needs and translate them into elegant and efficient user experiences. Solve challenging issues to understand what features our users want before they even ask for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Well with Others. You are a great software engineer in general; know a few languages, and especially javascript, html5, css3 inside and out. Can possibly overlap a little with the backend guys…knows a little about ruby/python/php or similar, along with a selection of web frameworks. Knows MVC, and understands its use-cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impress our customers. Constantly advocate for the best customer experience possible while balancing design and business objectives. Demonstrate deep understanding of customer interactions to transform complex design requirements into intuitive interface.  Create world-class customer experiences and beautiful visuals that support and reinforce StackSocial’s vision, brand, and business objectives across all platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience building for large-scale ecommerce site(s)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Benefits + Perks:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salary + Bonus: Competitive base + potential bonus based on experience and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity: Generous equity stake for the right candidate.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>User Interface Designer at Linea Photosharing LLC in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a talented designer with a passion for both web and mobile interfaces. You&amp;rsquo;re extremely passionate about designing and using web apps, websites, and mobile apps. You&amp;rsquo;re always exploring the latest and greatest. You keep a portfolio or blog of new design patterns and interesting UI treatments, which you usually explore in your next project. You abide by Steve Krug&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of minimizing thinking in interfaces, thus creating simple solutions to complex questions. As a designer, you love to discuss and critically dissect your work and the work of your peers because you believe the best designer is one that improves with feedback. Above all, you can describe your work as efficient, inspired,  and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day you&amp;rsquo;ll work with both the Product and Engineering teams to create beautiful interfaces that reach users around the world. A large part of your job will be to conceptualize and design original ideas that bring simplicity and ease of use to complex design issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate requirements into concepts and elegant user experience design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create interaction models, user task flows, screen designs, and UI details that promote ease of use and optimize the user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other designers as needed, and work independently to see a project through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner with Design Research to inform and improve interfaces and workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize complex sets of data in ways that are easy to comprehend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with Engineering to guide final implementation of design concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be working from our San Francisco office located at mid-market in the Twitter building (9th and Market).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience developing consumer and/or commercial web application interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record and a passion for designing compelling user experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid intuition of best practices and tools used in user-centered interaction design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong visual design skills, including an eye for good typography, composition, and use of color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluid ability to design in Photoshop, OmniGraffle, and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in creating various prototype methods and knowledge of best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to multitask, prioritize projects, and communicate progress and expected milestones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participation with the larger professional design community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and an understanding of how they play into interaction design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We pay special attention to those that are looking to create new experiences, not just re-purpose the old. Special consideration will be given to those that show entrepreneurial spirit, are looking to mold the organization, and help create a better agile development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candidates should have solid communication skills and the ability to both provide competitive and well-informed arguments, but at the same time be able to listen to strategic business, design and user needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UI Developer at awe.sm in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly every website, mobile app, or marketing campaign has a social layer now, but too few companies make use of the incredibly valuable social data generated each day by their own users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm has built a powerful platform that captures these data, connects them to real business goals, and enables our customers to harness the results to create value through our growing toolset, robust APIs, and integrations with leading 3rd-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve proven the value of our technology to a growing number of real customers – from startups to the Fortune 500, and now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to grow our team, our capabilities, and the reach of our platform. Our goal is to help our customers harness the rich intent and effectiveness data from social interactions to build more compelling applications, produce more relevant content, and market more effectively – anywhere social is driving value, awe.sm can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the job: turning Big Data into Great Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are collecting enormous amounts of data, and are constantly coming up with new things we can do with it. Your job is to take the power of our APIs and focus it down into clear, easy-to-understand interfaces that help our customers see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and make use of that information to meet their goals. You&amp;rsquo;ll be extending our GUI as well as knocking out prototypes that demonstrate to customers all the ways they can use the data our platform can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to think creatively and come up with novel, illuminating interfaces that make the value of our data more obvious, easier, and more fun to use. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to be handing you a PSD and telling you to get all the pixels lined up; we&amp;rsquo;re going to be explaining a problem and looking to you for a solution that nobody&amp;rsquo;s tried before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who you are: excited just from the job description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an experienced developer with a proven track record of getting things done on the web. We&amp;rsquo;re also looking for someone deeply interested in user interface design and the presentation of information. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have built something in this area already, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a side project. We want somebody who uses JavaScript for more than form validation, and knows more than just jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all we&amp;rsquo;re looking for honest enthusiasm: does the idea of building big new things and having to learn a lot to get them done fill you with a burning desire to get started right away? Then you&amp;rsquo;re the person we need. We want somebody who has big ideas and the technical chops to bring them to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm works with hundreds of customers large and small, from startups like Zaarly, StockTwits, and Topspin Media to not-so-startups like Groupon, Zynga, and Gilt Groupe. We’re backed by leading VC firms and are expanding from a team of 5 to 10–15. The salary is competitive and comes with a generous stock option plan as well as full health, dental and vision coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a technology-driven business, we are creating an engineering-driven organization. Personal development is one of our highest company priorities, and we believe that technical development is essential to a strong engineering culture. That translates into code reviews and tech talks to promote learning and assigning projects in ways that help team-members explore their interests first-hand. We hope this will be your favorite job, but we doubt it will be your last and we want every member of our team to walk away from this experience better equipped to pursue their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current front-end code is mostly in PHP using the Zend Framework (we like MVC, but are not big fans of Ruby on Rails). We want somebody unafraid of learning new languages and APIs to get things done. Our user interface is HTML5 with a lot of Javascript for visualizations. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably be pleased to hear that we do not support IE 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a close-knit team. It should go without saying since we&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we work flexible hours in casual dress. We mostly work out of our offices on the 6th floor of the US Bank building in the Mission, featuring truly awesome views. We value our ability to concentrate, so we&amp;rsquo;re a pretty quiet room and everyone&amp;rsquo;s got headphones, but our IRC room is always active, with both technical arguments and the latest YouTube videos. We eat lunch together every day, and socialize after work regularly. We are increasingly good at throwing surprise birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buzzwords:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Must-haves:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML (including HTML5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (actual knowledge of the language, not just jQuery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-haves (in order of niceness):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC framework (especially Zend Framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook and Twitter APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandiant, a fast growing information security company, is seeking a User Experience/Interaction Designer. At Mandiant, UX doesn’t just make things look pretty, we are involved at every level of the process—from kickoff meetings, to interaction design, to help documentation. The ideal candidate is someone who can move easily between strategy and implementation and who is able to develop a deep understanding of the business, our users, and the technology. You must have great people skills and the ability to communicate and build trust with stakeholders, customers, managers, and developers. If you love building applications, but are tired of shopping carts and social media, we have some wonderfully complex and technical design problems you can really sink your teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your typical day here might include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting out with doing user research with internal users and customers, then a meeting with developers to nail down feature requirements and scope. Proceeding to a rapid sketching session with the team. Partaking in lunch (yes, there is such a thing as free lunch, catered every Friday and delicious) and catching up on the latest activity of evildoers. Next, a kickoff workshop with stakeholders to develop a product roadmap. Then you’ll create annotated wireframes to release to developers and finish the day with knocking out a few buttons in Photoshop in time for a product release. If this energizes you then please read on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Essential Duties and Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create user interface designs that delight our highly technical end users by discovering what they really need through user interviews and other creative research methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create context-appropriate deliverables such as sketches, wireframes, task flows, scenarios, and personas to communicate designs, drive decisions, and reach consensus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employ user-centered methodology to design applications with cohesive organization, elegant navigation, and effective labeling and search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate stakeholder meetings and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help build a sustainable UX practice that can scale with the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze, report on, and incorporate feedback from usability testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create production assets from design comps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building and refining interface designs on projects with highly technical stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to establish technical credibility when working with developers to negotiate implementation direction and options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History of planning and delivering UI projects involving both usability and development activities in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience performing usability testing in an agile context or on a small, &amp;ldquo;Rocket Surgery&amp;rdquo; scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in OmniGraffle, Visio, or comparable wireframing tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in Adobe Photoshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Additional Valued Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise application design experience desired, but not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience conducting user research and task analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual design experience. Data visualization experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong technical skills—HTML, CSS, javascript are useful, but not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with version control systems, such as GitHub and Subversion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention to detail, including grammar and spelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Education/Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B.S. or B.A. in Computer Science or comparable work-related experience in Interaction Design, User Experience, HCI or Information Architecture, visual design, or related technical platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This position may be located in our office in Alexandria, VA (headquarters) Reston, VA or New York City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are unable to sponsor or transfer work visas at this time&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior User Experience Designer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We believe in the power of stories. And we love transforming data into insights. We help people tell compelling stories with data &amp;ndash; data of all sizes, shapes, and kind; through highly interactive, visually rich products that are used anytime, anywhere (desktop, web, mobile, and more…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the design discipline within the Microsoft Data Platform Group, the second largest business within Microsoft. We work as an integrated product design team with program management, development and test &amp;ndash; to envision, create, craft and deliver next generation experiences for Microsoft’s data platform in the areas of business intelligence, big data, information services and information visualization on the cloud, based on deep understanding of what makes our users tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our world-class product design teams are expanding, and we are looking for Senior UX Designers to own the design leadership and execution of key end to end experiences for our next generation end user tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This person must be an excellent hands on designer that can create exciting results on their own, and both participate in and lead a cross-functional team through a collaborative design process to deliver rapid prototypes, user stories, concept sketches, experience storyboards, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, motion design, design research and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senior UX designer needs to be competent in all of facets of the design process, and exceptionally talented and skilled in at least one major area (e.g. Visual and motion design, or Interaction and information architecture design). Most importantly, the senior designer needs to have sufficient conviction in their designs to own the emotional dimensions of the product, ensuring that the experience delivered is ultimately emotionally irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This might just be you, if you are…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As passionate about data and data visualization as we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A well-rounded UX professional who connects the dots between business needs, innovation and good design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced at driving a user experience from start-to-finish that delivers results, connects emotionally, and makes customers smile again and again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsessed with good user-centered design practices and have an eye for detail (That font. That grid. That color. That gesture. That motion. &amp;ldquo;Ahhh!&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you have at least 5 years of UX design experience (and the portfolio to prove it), then you are someone we want to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced degree in Human Computer Interaction, Digital Media Design, Industrial Design, Fine Arts or related field is desired.
Strong skills in visual and motion design preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Basic Qualification:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 5 years as a key, hands-on interaction/visual designer of a UI/UX team through the product development cycle of successfully launched web, mobile, and/or software applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why be just a part of the future when you can actually create it? Apply today to join our talented team of inter-disciplinary designers, design researchers, program managers and product developers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at Warby Parker in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some front-end devs started out as designers and then learned to code. Others started out as programmers and then fell in love with design. And the rest tackled the full stack at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you came to it, we’re looking for someone who loves building great user experiences and is skilled in the tools necessary to build them. If that sounds like you, we should talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with our designers to transform Adobe CS files into beautiful, fast web pages that make a user’s day better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be working through most of our web stack  — from static HTML and CSS to interactive designs with a lot of JS to the site’s Magento back end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain JS and CSS libraries to use throughout our site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll love about working here:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company is reshaping the eyewear industry. That industry is massive, and we&amp;rsquo;re growing fast. We love being here to see that happen, and we love working hard to speed it along. It&amp;rsquo;s an electrifying climate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be work on a very small team, and you&amp;rsquo;ll own a lot of the projects that you work on. We often release important, high-visibility features that were done by just one developer. That developer often will be you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our location in the heart of Soho. We&amp;rsquo;re in the Puck Building, which is lucky enough to have its own Wikipedia entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have delicious catered lunches three days a week and a steady supply of snacks in the kitchen. And for when that all catches up with you, we offer free membership at the 24 Hour Fitness across the street from the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Necessary attributes:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong, well-formed opinions about what makes for a good user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience implementing those opinions in user-facing work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert-level skill in hand-coded HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaningful real-world experience writing jQuery and vanilla JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrable skill in writing high-quality server-side code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talent as a writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfort with the Adobe CS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Useful attributes:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A track record of building interesting and/or challenging side projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magento experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience developing web sites for iOS and Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gift of flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

You&amp;rsquo;ll find us always focused on the next big thing, with our heads in our iPhones, iPads, Androids, Mobile Web, and our killer CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CrowdCompass has built 435 native apps so far for events of all sizes and industries. In the last year, our customers had over 500,000 downloads. Going forward our app solutions will be even better because we’re now backed by Cvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Position Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an iOS Developer you&amp;rsquo;ll be working closely with our small but growing engineering team in crafting the best mobile apps the events industry has ever seen. This is an experienced position that requires fluency with the latest ObjC language extensions and Cocoa frameworks. You should be motivated to explore and deliver the best possible solutions to our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Position Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on all aspects of iOS projects with an emphasis on intuitive, custom UI controls and interfaces that provide a great user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be interpreting UI/UX requirements and mockups into functional, high-performance iPhone and iPad apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the latest technologies, test, implement, and report back to the team on what you’ve discovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the boundaries of what’s possible with creative solutions to hard, mobile-centric problems like synchronization, asynchronous APIs, and leveraging offline device capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Candidate Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of Cocoa design patterns and the iOS/Xcode developer toolchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience collaborating with senior back-end and senior mobile developers in an agile environment with little supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive hands-on experience creating custom UI controls, consuming RESTful APIs, designing protocols, implementing delegate interfaces, animations, and performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instruments is your long-time BFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with TDD, Sentest, and OCMock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see all of the potential of mobile, and you know how to get the most out of the iOS platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve worked on a team and are comfortable using Git.  In fact, you probably have a Github account you’ll want to show us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What We Offer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good compensation—we don’t want you to starve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good benefits—we want you healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fun work environment—no cubes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team and management that will help you improve over time—like cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at weeSpring in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a front-end developer with an entrepreneurial bent to join our team. You&amp;rsquo;ll be crafting new page templates, emails, AJAX requests, user interactions, and rewriting the existing front end to match your high standards. You have free rein to use whatever libs and technology you want for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our development process is hyper agile, with continuous deployment to our development site, and we release new code to production several times a day. Our tech stack is Python using the Django framework and Jinja2 template engine, MySQL (Percona Server), Nginx, hosted on Amazon AWS. All pages are served in under 500 milliseconds&amp;hellip; without caching. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who can make our front end just as fast and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a young company, and as such, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room for you to grow and take on new responsibility. Our team is built upon mutual respect, autonomy, and a humble awareness and acceptance of our strengths and weaknesses. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone to work with us, not for us. That means competitive salaries and meaningful equity for the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an HTML/CSS3, Javascript and jQuery ninja&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve worked with back end engineers before and you know what makes their life easier and how to plan a project with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a thorough knowledge of cross-browser compatibility issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got knowledge of cutting edge technologies, but more importantly, the common sense to know when to use them and when to stick with traditional methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re self-motivated, self-directed, and can work without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand that done is better than perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Nice to have&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve worked with startups and/or small companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience building a mobile site and/or responsive design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re familiar with and have an opinion on SASS/LESS, domain sharing, asynchronous loading, icon fonts, sprites, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know all the little graceful degradation tricks for the above techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re obsessed with page load times and seem to always have a waterfall graph open when you&amp;rsquo;re viewing a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have an interest in taking on product and/or design responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Application Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the form at right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please do not include a formal cover letter.  Instead please use the cover letter space at right to tell us what you find interesting about weeSpring and provide us three suggestions for improving weeSpring&amp;rsquo;s user experience or design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you have an interest in taking on product and/or design responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Show thought leadership in suggesting new product features, novel interactions, and innovative solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay on top of trends in design, data visualization, and mobile technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A history of positive teamwork and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentlessly high quality standards and extreme attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in standard design tools such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Desirable Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

				<title>Senior Operations Developer at AWeber in Chalfont, PA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Senior Operations Developer role focuses on pushing forward efforts in system automation and deployment using tools like Chef and Puppet, building REST APIs using Python frameworks like Flask and Tornado, and researching new solutions to help drive platform innovation in any part of the organization. The role also participates in many other initiatives, not the least of which is solidifying and furthering our commitment to collaboration and cooperation between development and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A sampling of the types of projects performed by this role might include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building out event-oriented message queuing architectures to increase efficiency and open data streams to multiple applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and/or build new solutions to provide new services and functionality to the internal application platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate and expand the collection and use of metrics, leveraging new &amp;amp; existing tools to provide visualizations to both business and technical parts of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;You:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an experienced engineer. You’ve worked on multiple projects in various environments. You’ve put things into production, you’ve had people use them, you’ve failed, you’ve succeeded, you’ve paid your dues, and learned your lessons. You have a passion for technology, and view what you do as a craft. You like your job, but love your work. It’s something you’d do (and have done) even if there were no money or job involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You enjoy working with open source languages, toolchains, systems, and databases, and are always seeking out new solutions to difficult problems. Where those solutions are found lacking, you contribute, and occasionally build your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cringe at the thought of having to make a definitive choice between doing only software engineering or only systems engineering. You like to have your hands in all of it, and to be able to understand and affect change to any part of your work, front end to back end. You strongly resist pigeonholing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thrive in environments where technological and innovative velocity is high, and the overhead from administrivia is low. You can work well in isolation, but are happy to collaborate in a team setting, and might not even mind doing the occasional pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWeber’s engineering team is a dynamic and exciting place to be. We use open source technologies like PostgreSQL, Python, MongoDB, Redis, Riak, Chef, Ruby, Graphite, and RabbitMQ. We use approaches to software quality like Test-Driven Development, Continuous Deployment, and a healthy addiction to metrics that give us insight into our applications, and how well they’re serving our customers. We have a mode of execution built around Kanban, and a Kaizen culture of continuous improvement. We believe in the kind of transparency, processes, data sharing, collaboration, and communication that foster a DevOps culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% Company Paid PPO medical, dental, vision, insurance. (including domestic partner benefits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Short Term Disability Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Life Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuition reimbursement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully Reimbursed Gym Memberships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 weeks paid time off  (plus increases in paid time off)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid holidays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;401K retirement benefits with company match and profit sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free lunches everyday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break rooms stocked with soda, juices, coffee and teas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro laptops and 30&quot; monitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple high definition theater rooms fully equipped with xbox, wii &amp;amp; blu-ray players&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>UI/UX Designer at Actiance in Belmont, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What legacy are you leaving behind?  Are your designs getting lost among the many websites and tools that are accessed by only a limited group of users?  Are you ready to start a legacy by designing a social enterprise tool that is reaching thousands and thousands of end users each day?  Do you want your work to be proudly displayed and used by our top-notch clients &amp;ndash; highly visible professionals from across all industries? Then you may be ready to join the Actiance Design Team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You are ready to join if:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a forward thinker, ready at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice to brainstorm creative solutions to share with a team as excited as you are to solve challenges. You doodle on anything you can get your hands on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You love to talk through ideas and collaborate, and you aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to challenge the status quo.  Think your manager or the VP of Product Management or CEO is wrong?  Then tell us &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s part of your success!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an expert on social and Web 2.0 design, and your portfolio proves it.  Not only that, but you also think about progressive enhancements such as mobile layouts and always asks &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s next?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The technical aspect:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a superb prototyper, using HTML 5, CSS 3, Adobe tools, storyboards, process flow diagrams &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as long as you can communicate your ideas!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will own user experience testing &amp;ndash; from developing scenarios and questions for a target audience to collecting, analyzing, and presenting outcomes to Product Management, Engineering, and the Executive Team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since our team is fast moving, you would be considered a ROCK-STAR if you could then code your ideas using jquery so that Engineering gets your design just right.  This would tip the scale and guarantee you a chat with our hiring team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our business is growing &amp;ndash; too rapidly, we think &amp;ndash; we need bold thinkers who will challenge the status quo and use their creativity to launch our product into full maturity.  Your initial goals will be to come up with a plan of attack on how to improve our current products.  You will also call the shots and formalize our design process to improve and establish guidelines.  This is a great opportunity for someone looking for the chance to take a product that is in early stages and be a key contributor to designing the framework from the ground up.  You will have a lot of creativity to contribute and you will have the technical skills to carry it out!
Pls send over a link to your portfolio when you apply.
If you are interested in this position, please e-mail your resume to jobs@actiance.com, and reference job UI/UX Designer (Req #350004) in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails Developer at ZOLL in Dallas, TX</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between this job and being a super hero? Both involve saving lives, but we actually pay you.
We are the leader for management and training of life saving devices such as defibrillators. We have the resources and stability of a large company, but the nimbleness, ambition, and determination of a startup, because we used to be one.
We have a small, highly motivated team and the most important thing is to be a demonstrated self-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we have to offer you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention super hero? Our office is casual enough you could wear a super hero costume, although shorts and flip flops may be more appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectually engaging discussions about software architecture among self-proclaimed experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciation that the work you do makes us a better company (mostly in the form of a competitive salary and benefits, but could also include cookies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mean what we say &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies for three consecutive years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Fortune&amp;rsquo;s list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What we are looking for from you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super hero like ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails coding skills that would make DHH proud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly insatiable appetite to solve difficult problems fast, which may mean the fewest CPU cycles or developer cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok, and maybe some technical prowess with Git/Github, TDD, Postgres, OSX, Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design/front-end skills are a big plus &amp;ndash; particularly standards-based clean, maintainable markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of humor, because really, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t this all be fun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have many exciting projects to get involved in, and we continue to seek clients that have significant social impact or provide tangible business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that software delivered is delivered qualitatively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead and mentor a small group of eager learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in a results only environment. Work where and when you want, as long as the work gets done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a very small and innovative consulting company that endeavors to delight its clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with clients to discover and confirm requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve interesting problems in the simplest way possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write well tested and expressive ruby&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most work can and will be done remotely, but we find pairing and collaboration to be most effective when we’re physically working alongside each another.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe in getting customer validation early, verifying with real data, but also running with our gut. The small team includes UI/UX design and product management, but everyone on the team is responsible for the success of our products, including that we’re building the right thing in the first place, and that it’s polished and beautiful when it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re seeking a developer with a passion for UI/UX, great HTML/CSS/Javascript skills and that can own the entire stack of a Ruby on Rails app, including ongoing operations and maintenance.

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;You should be very strong on all of the following:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML/CSS – not a web designer, but extremely good at implementing markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript – including jQuery and cross-browser compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance optimization, SQL tuning, caching strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to own projects end-to-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Attach a resume, but also include something about yourself in your message. Tell us why you love the product, why you want to work at Heroku, why you want this job, and why you’re qualified. Use the resume to back yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UI samples (or URLs) should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position does require that you live in, or be willing to relocate to, San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

Our work environment is fun and flexible while also ruthlessly focused on technical excellence and customer success. Our growing group offers lots of opportunities for hyper talented, self- motivated, no-drama and no-nonsense individuals who share our belief that cloud architectures are dramatically changing web application development and deployment, and want to be part of the vanguard of this movement.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Come learn and grow with LaunchWare. It’s a great opportunity to improve your coding skills and create awesome applications. This is a full time position. Learn all the coolest, client-side technologies like HTML5, SCSS, BackboneJS, and Jasmine while honing your Rails skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to contribute to an application that will really help people find what they need? We’ve launched a network for cancer patients and their loved ones so that they can find better care, more support, and connections with others that have similar experience. We’re anticipating heavy traffic volumes and usage as the client has partnered with American Cancer Society. This is truly a fun, rewarding project and an excellent client. There’s some really interesting problems here around matching users with relevant peers, resources, events, and services among many others. We have many other exciting projects to get involved in, and we continue to seek clients that have significant, social, impact in areas like Healthcare and beyond. Come solve their problems with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You will:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in a results only environment. Work where and when you want, as long as the work gets done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn design patterns and architectural techniques that help web applications scale and change with requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn JQuery and Backbone.js along with other exciting client side technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to write tests first and implementation second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain Rails 3 applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to write good user stories, acceptance criteria, and acceptance tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that software delivered is delivered qualitatively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write semantic, W3C compliant markup and unobtrusive, object oriented javascript with JQuery and Backbone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write well tested and expressive ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve interesting problems in the simplest way possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with clients to discover and confirm requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a very small and innovative consulting company that endeavors to delight its clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with the company’s principal and founder, Dan Pickett and a growing team of enthusiastic developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What We’re looking for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical, demonstrated knowledge of web standards and best practices in front end development (HTML5/CSS3, Semantic Markup, Progressive Enhancement, W3C compliance, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid communication skills as indicated from references. You will interface directly with clients on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong, insatiable desire to learn and hone your craft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A demonstrated understanding of the Rails framework and MVC fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two years experience in the web development field, preferably with interpreted, back-end technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A familiarity with object oriented design and architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean, well thought out code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;It would rock if you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have built a few rails applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have written javascript and understand JQuery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideal candidate gets excited about learning new things and working with various parts of the Rails stack. Your goals should include establishing yourself as a helpful and integral member of the Web Development community at large. If you don’t want to build and share your knowledge, this is not the gig for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Resumes are great, but practical application and endorsements from your peers, employers or clients will secure the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most work can be done remotely, but we find pairing and collaboration to be most effective when we’re physically working alongside each another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the Company:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaunchWare is a web development consultancy that loves to ship. We work towards establishing quantifiable value for all of our clients. We refine, build, and deploy quality software that solves real problems. We speak business first and geek a close second, ensuring that clients get software that solves their problems as simply as possible. We are firm believers in the promises of Agile Development methodologies and efficient web frameworks. We are lifelong learners, teachers, thinkers, and innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next year, we plan to continue building great applications for our clients. We’re also building training programs, publications, and our own products as well. Come help shape the vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s truly an opportunity to get involved in some great projects and learn a lot. We hope to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No third parties or agencies, please.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;At Apptio we are focused on changing the world by making every IT organization that we work with into a more efficient and cost-effective service provider to the business. Apptio&amp;rsquo;s Technology Business Management (TBM) SaaS platform provides revolutionary automation in transparency, planning and performance management required for IT to run like a business. From the founding of the company we set out to disrupt the existing enterprise software market by designing purpose-built, on-demand applications capable of managing the cost, quality and value of IT services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Apptio is on track to become the fastest growing company in the history of enterprise software. Leading global enterprise organizations such as Bank of America, Boeing, Cisco, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Health System, and Swiss Re rely on Apptio to reduce costs and align IT with business priorities. Backed by some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prominent financial institutions including T. Rowe Price, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners, Madrona Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Apptio is building the next major enterprise software category. Come join our team!&lt;/p&gt;

You thrive in fast paced, iterative design environments and possess clear, effective communication skills. You work collaboratively across the organization – while also working independently. You pay attention to the details without forgetting the big picture. You have vision, moxie, and a track record that shows both. You love working with a small, quirky UX team that preaches, teaches, and gets their hands dirty in the name of getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with the UX team, product managers, and developers to design next-generation user interfaces and solve ongoing usability problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a positive, engaging force for UI and UX within the organization and proactively find opportunities to improve our customer’s success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and present your design work in industry standard mockup and wireframing tools (and ideally in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience designing enterprise and/or technical web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven track record for designing compelling, accessible and standards-based user experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert user of design and prototyping tools (e.g. Axure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of the advantages and limits of web pages as design surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with disparate, cross-functional groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-task, prioritize and communicate progress effectively to multiple stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthesize feedback while maintaining ownership of the design process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong sketching/drawing skills and/or wireframing electronically (e.g. Balsamiq).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Informatics, Design, Computer Science).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML, CSS and Javascript (JQuery) prototyping skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of usability and user research best practices and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of typography, color, imagery, composition and other graphic elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Agile and Scrum development process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proactively manage communication and relationships with stakeholders, internal creative team, and external creative vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anticipate issues before they become problems; deal with problems gracefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to identify risks and escalate them as needed for support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage creative team meeting schedules; hold effective meetings with clearly stated goals and objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with creative team leadership to monitor and make improvements to creative processes for continual improvement of project delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take detailed meeting notes and distribute documentation as required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support creative team leadership in enforcing Sony creative guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be passionate about client success and delivering the highest quality work&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Senior Designer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We believe in the power of stories. And we love transforming data into insights. We help people tell compelling stories with data &amp;ndash; data of all sizes, shapes, and kind; through highly interactive, visually rich products that are used anytime, anywhere (desktop, web, mobile, and more…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the design discipline within the Microsoft Data Platform Group, the second largest business within Microsoft. We work as an integrated product design team with program management, development and test &amp;ndash; to envision, create, craft and deliver next generation experiences for Microsoft’s data platform in the areas of business intelligence, big data, information services and information visualization on the cloud, based on deep understanding of what makes our users tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our world-class product design teams are expanding, and we are looking for Senior UX Designers to own the design leadership and execution of key end to end experiences for our next generation end user tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This person must be an excellent hands on designer that can create exciting results on their own, and both participate in and lead a cross-functional team through a collaborative design process to deliver rapid prototypes, user stories, concept sketches, experience storyboards, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, motion design, design research and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senior UX designer needs to be competent in all of facets of the design process, and exceptionally talented and skilled in at least one major area (e.g. Visual and motion design, or Interaction and information architecture design). Most importantly, the senior designer needs to have sufficient conviction in their designs to own the emotional dimensions of the product, ensuring that the experience delivered is ultimately emotionally irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This might just be you, if you are…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As passionate about data and data visualization as we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A well-rounded UX professional who connects the dots between business needs, innovation and good design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced at driving a user experience from start-to-finish that delivers results, connects emotionally, and makes customers smile again and again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsessed with good user-centered design practices and have an eye for detail (That font. That grid. That color. That gesture. That motion. &amp;ldquo;Ahhh!&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you have at least 5 years of UX design experience (and the portfolio to prove it), then you are someone we want to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Required Basic Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 5 years as a key, hands-on interaction/visual designer of a UI/UX team through the product development cycle of successfully launched web, mobile, and/or software applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 5 years of interactive and/or visual design experience (and the portfolio to prove it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Preferred Basic Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s degree in Human Computer Interaction, Digital Media Design, Industrial Design, Fine Arts or related field is desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong skills in visual and motion design are a big plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why be just a part of the future when you can actually create it? Apply today to join our talented team of inter-disciplinary designers, design researchers, program managers and product developers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails Developer at ZOLL in Dallas, TX</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between this job and being a super hero? Both involve saving lives, but we actually pay you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the leader for management and training of life saving devices such as defibrillators. We have the resources and stability of a large company, but the nimbleness, ambition, and determination of a startup, because we used to be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a small, highly motivated team and the most important thing is to be a demonstrated self-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Duties:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What we have to offer you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention super hero? Our office is casual enough you could wear a super hero costume, although shorts and flip flops may be more appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectually engaging discussions about software architecture among self-proclaimed experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciation that the work you do makes us a better company (mostly in the form of a competitive salary and benefits, but could also include cookies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mean what we say &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies for three consecutive years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Fortune&amp;rsquo;s list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for from you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super hero like ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails coding skills that would make DHH proud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly insatiable appetite to solve difficult problems fast, which may mean the fewest CPU cycles or developer cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok, and maybe some technical prowess with Git/Github, TDD, Postgres, OSX, Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design/front-end skills are a big plus &amp;ndash; particularly standards-based clean, maintainable markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of humor, because really, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t this all be fun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Junior Web Developer at Nyaya Health in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Nyaya Health is seeking a paid, full-time Web Developer as the 3rd member of its growing U.S.-based team. Applications are being accepted on an immediate rolling basis for candidates that are open to start work in Nyaya Health&amp;rsquo;s NYC office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web Developer will be provided a rare opportunity to use their skills in a critical role in an early-stage, growing organization dedicated to building health care solutions for the world&amp;rsquo;s poorest people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you the right fit? The ideal orientation.We are looking for a talented developer and committed self-learner hungry to use their skills for good that will build the back-end infrastructure of the most innovative, exciting, and contagious global health brand of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, your orientation toward the work should match well with our operating values, or what we call our &amp;ldquo;cultural DNA&amp;rdquo;. See those here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, you&amp;rsquo;re entrepreneurial, have phenomenal coding skills for the platform we currently use the most (WordPress), committed to learning new coding languages over time, and are excited by the challenge of being asked to take on a large, diverse set of responsibilities in the fast-moving environment of a young, growing organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t be in the market for a dry 9-5 &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo;, but instead, you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an opportunity to use your time to transform and grow with a young organization to change hundreds of thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Must-haves:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development experience: At minimum, we need you to be truly talented in the WordPress platform and the skills that are important to it (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL). 1-2 years of experience delivering significant web projects is strongly preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment to translating design: The Web Developer will be 1 of 3 full-time employees based in the NYC office, alongside an Executive Director and Creative Director. Thus, a close partnership will be required to work with the Creative Director to translate their designs. The Creative Director has background in web design, but only basic abilities in CSS and HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel to Nepal: You will be in the U.S. at least 80% of the time. But your ability to be successful depends on your ability to understand our programs, data, and reporting systems in an extremely different environment in rural Nepal. Your systems design and code are the central connection between that corner of Nepal, our team, and a broad global audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A commitment to innovative development: We intend for our impact evaluation and fundraising systems to be regarded as a paragon within global health. We want you to thrive in the challenge of designing creative and inventive ways to connect people with our work while upholding the highest standards of transparency. If you have the commitment to learn, we can connect you to best-in-class tech mentors in the NYC social impact space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in or willingness to train in Salesforce CRM: We have a newly created Salesforce CRM that needs support. You will need to be willing to provide support in integrating and automating functions across our web presence with the database. Our experience suggests that developers can self-train in the system quickly even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t had much specific Salesforce CRM experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web Developer will be a member of a 3-person team alongside the Executive Director and Creative Director and will be challenged over time to go beyond being a developer to also taking a lead role in designing and building creative technology systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the web strategy of the organization efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand and maintain Nyaya Health&amp;rsquo;s new WordPress-based website and blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate back-office systems (accounting, Salesforce CRM, development dashboards) to our donor-facing web applications for fundraising, reporting, and impact evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oversee migration from our current Wiki information platform (wiki.nyayahealth.org) to a more design-friendly, visual and intuitive micro-site housed within www.nyayahealth.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oversee the maintenance and use of the Salesforce CRM platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the availability and security of all IT systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build creative in-kind partnerships where organizational gaps exist – in areas like analytics and SEO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be our technology evangelist, internally and externally, by demonstrating an incredible passion for how technology can connect our supporters and patients in meaningful ways and make our work more efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Location:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyaya Health&amp;rsquo;s new office located at 17 W. 17th Street in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 1 trip to Nepal per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connections to NYC&amp;rsquo;s top social impact tech talent through organizational partnerships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for professional development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyayahealth.org/join-us/&quot;&gt;http://www.nyayahealth.org/join-us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application process: Please send the materials below to humanresources@nyayahealth.org with &amp;ldquo;Web Developer Application – Your Name&amp;rdquo; in the subject line of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show, don&amp;rsquo;t tell. Send us a portfolio of your work (which includes your resume). We are being purposefully vague in our explanation here. Please send us whatever format (or combination of formats) best exemplifies your work that can be reviewed in less than 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us (or show us) your story, and why you&amp;rsquo;re committed to doing whatever it takes to bring health care to the rural poor in Nepal. Just make it fit on one page and break free from the confines of the traditional cover letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What happens after submission? Your submission will be responded to within 4 days, and if the application is advanced, we will ask for two references and an in-person meeting (or substitute a video chat if we have to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If selected for the position, we will offer a paid 1-month trial period to allow us to work together so you can decide if you want to sign a longer-term contract and commit yourself to our mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legal Terms:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that my submission of this employment application does not obligate the Company (Bloomberg L.P., its subsidiaries, divisions and any affiliated entities, collectively &amp;ldquo;the Company&amp;rdquo;) to employ me, or to offer me employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that if I am hired for a position in the United States of America, I will be employed on an at-will basis, which means that: (a) my employment and compensation are not guaranteed for any definite period, and can be terminated, with or without cause, and with or without notice, by either the Company or myself, and (b) there is no written or oral agreement or representation that can alter my at-will status except an individual written agreement signed by the Chief Executive Officer of Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that the information on this application (and accompanying documents, if any) is true and complete to the best of my knowledge. I am responsible for ensuring that the information I submit is accurate and up-to-date. I may review or update my personal information at any time using this site or by entering a request via Careers- Feedback . I also agree that any misstatement, false information, or omission deemed significant by Bloomberg may disqualify me from consideration, and/or may be reason for discharge if discovered after an offer of employment has been extended to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that I am not party to any agreement, or subject to any legal obligation, that would in any way restrict me, or interfere with me from fully performing the requirements of the job for which I am applying, and that I must disclose to the Company any such agreement or obligation before the Company considers my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that if I am selected to proceed with the application process, I may be given or obtain access to non-public information that the Company considers to be of a confidential, proprietary, or trade secret nature (&amp;ldquo;Confidential Information&amp;rdquo;). I agree that I will not directly or indirectly disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, and that I will not use the Confidential Information for my own benefit or for the benefit of any third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I agree that if I am offered employment at Bloomberg, that such offer, and continued employment, is contingent on the results of a reference check and background investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that the Company is an equal employment opportunity/affirmative action employer, and that the application process will be conducted in accord with applicable EEO/affirmative action requirements where the relevant position is located. I understand and agree that Bloomberg may use any personal information submitted in my application for the purpose of considering my suitability for employment, as well as for general statistical analysis and reporting purposes, including candidate activity and demographic reports. Bloomberg will process my information in compliance with applicable laws on privacy and data protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that if Bloomberg does not employ me at this time, Bloomberg may retain and use the information that it obtains as part of the application process to consider my application later if a suitable position becomes available and, if appropriate, to refer back to this application if I apply again. If at any time I no longer want Bloomberg to consider my application for employment, I understand I must enter a request via Careers- Feedback, in which case the information will be stored securely for no more than one year from the date of notification, and access to it will only be made to the extent necessary for legal and regulatory purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Bloomberg is a global company and that it will process my information on its servers in the United States of America. Bloomberg is committed to compliance with its privacy obligations and for that reason will apply the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable, when processing my information on its US servers. I further agree that if I am applying for a position outside the EEA and US, Bloomberg may also process my information on its servers in the country in which the relevant position is located and comply with the privacy legislation in that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand my information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies, or third parties where required and where necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En Masse Entertainment is seeking a Web Developer to extend, refine, and maintain the front-end and back-end aspects of our web presence. This person will work in an open and collaborative environment with friendly, driven professionals, and strive to increase awareness of En Masse and the games we publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we&amp;rsquo;d like you to contribute as a key stakeholder in designing simple, intuitive, and engaging web pages. UX isn&amp;rsquo;t the main goal of this position however, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be dinged for having a lack of design/UX experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of typical tasks, over the last few months, our web developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implemented mockups for a new web store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applied a new design to an existing site based on a series of high-fidelity mockups by writing HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or templates in Ruby on Rails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;researched, discussed, and implemented best practices for e-commerce product purchase workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developed a Ruby app (using Sinatra) to utilize a series of API calls for a web storefront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implemented security patches to site dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made our automated tests more robust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wore a wizard hat when they broke the production site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bragged over their current position on the in-house leveling leaderboard for TERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If these tasks sound interesting to you, we&amp;rsquo;d love to see your resume!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in web development or equivalent degree/experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience developing front-end code for websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience developing back-end code for websites is a plus (ideally with Ruby and Ruby on Rails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;familiarity with version control systems, especially Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passion for video games, especially MMORPGs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Fun Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;free snacks and sodas in the kitchen&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>User Interface (UI) Designer at Liftopia in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our products are nothing without easy-to-use and straight-forward interfaces that get out of people&amp;rsquo;s way and help users achieve their goals (in this case, getting out to the slopes!). We&amp;rsquo;re looking to expand our product/design team by adding a designer who believes usability is an important component to badass online experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role requires a mix of user interface and visual design skills. You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you believe usability &amp;amp; delight goes beyond (but still works closely with) visual aesthetics, this may very well be the perfect role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online portfolio is required to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on web and/or mobile applications in the consumer space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong design background with expert knowledge of page hierarchy, typography, color theory, and branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience developing and designing: wireframes, mockups, site maps, storyboards, task flows, design specifications, and/or landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You find little touches of personality in interfaces delightful and make an effort to bring that kind of &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; feel to your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility in learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work within, manage and extend design styleguides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert in web design tools (ie: Fireworks, Photoshop, llustrator, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Axure, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with usability testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches &amp;amp; wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess a self-motivated, &amp;ldquo;git &amp;lsquo;er done&amp;rdquo; work ethic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 years minimum experience designing interfaces that incorporate &amp;amp; extend a brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;PLUSES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototyping code abilities (HTML, CSS, light JS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise user interface design experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;IS LIFTOPIA A GOOD FIT FOR YOU?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the typical startup/tech industry benefits (like unlimited vacation, health insurance, bonus pool, flexible schedule, stock options, and so on), Liftopia would be a great fit if you identify with any (or all!) of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire &amp;amp; effort to grow and remain relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company culture &amp;ndash; like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days &amp;ndash; appeals and is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you&amp;rsquo;re curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>User Experience (UX) Designer at Liftopia in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You: Motivated &amp;amp; talented designer with a knack for creating easy-to-use &amp;amp; clean web apps. You believe communication is the key to good working relationships and helping others understand your vision. You desire a role where you will have a tangible and meaningful impact on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role requires a mix of UX design, visual design and basic prototyping skills (HTML, CSS, some JS). You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you are open to learning from data &amp;amp; qualitative findings and incorporating those into your work, this may very well be the perfect role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience working within an interactive or UX agency environment with a variety of clients is desired. Enterprise and/or mobile experience is a huge plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online portfolio with sample workflow designs and projects from start to finish (a link is required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches &amp;amp; wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience developing and designing: wireframes, mockups, site maps, storyboards, task flows, design specifications, and/or landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong design background with expert knowledge of page hierarchy, typography, color theory, and branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open to learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work within and manage a design styleguide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert in full Adobe CS suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with usability testing and incorporating findings to designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess a self-motivated, driven work ethic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 years minimum experience designing a mix of brand elements and user experience design flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;IS LIFTOPIA A GOOD FIT FOR YOU?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the typical startup/tech industry benefits (like unlimited vacation, health insurance, bonus pool, flexible schedule, stock options, and so on), Liftopia would be a great fit if you identify with any (or all!) of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire &amp;amp; effort to grow and remain relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company culture &amp;ndash; like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days &amp;ndash; appeals and is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you&amp;rsquo;re curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;ABOUT LIFTOPIA&lt;/h2&gt;

If you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about innovation, come help revolutionize how companies collaborate and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk.com is a fast-paced startup inside Salesforce.com, which means you get the best of both worlds: small teams, fun projects, and fast execution backed by the vast resources of a publicly traded company. We have the cool vibe of a startup and the dependability of an established player. We are headquartered in San Francisco and have really cool offices south of Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a highly-motivated Sr. UI Designer with a strong understanding of design, to contribute in shaping the user interface of our product and strengthening our online presence across web, tablet, and mobile devices. We drive our product by the user experience, and need someone with the skills who can keep up and push the vision forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Work directly with product managers, front-end engineers, and other UI designers to insure we maintain a high-quality user experience.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required/Desired Skills:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a master of your craft and tools. As a designer you are expected to have a dominating control over Photoshop, as well as create satisfying interfaces boasting user-centered design principles for our core applications. Bonus for a dribbble or other online portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get excited to work with some of the coolest clients on the web on a product that people love using. With customers like 37signals, Rdio, Square, Pandora, many more, we’re building software that real companies are using and we need you to contribute to our evolution. You must be excited about your role! Anybody can build something that’s “good”, but true passion breeds “incredible.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like to deliver real results. So, you’ve got some design and prototyping chops but do you have the ability to bring your work to life? This is a great opportunity to expand your front-end skills, and learn from an exceptionally talented team. You’ll need to be able to build those great experiences with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bonus if terms like HAML, CoffeeScript, and AngularJS not only make sense to you, but excite you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Preferred:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous agency experience preferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to design high-end executive presentations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A working knowledge of CSS, and HTML would be awesome&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A passion for learning about new technology and design trends&lt;/li&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;You love to build products. You love to hack on web code. You love large scaling challenges, neat and complex algorithms, and working with a talented passionate team making a dent in the universe. You should work at Smarterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to measure the world’s skills. We’re tapping into the fundamental need for people to be able to measure what they know, engaging the increasing number of digital tools that are part of everyone’s lives, and building a reliable way to prove skills to others (peers, employers, and the world). We’re small but growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In joining our team, you’ll have a strong voice in our technology and product. We also believe that hacking is akin to painting so we’re not shy about making sure you’ll have the exact right tools for you to get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who we’re looking for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal fit for us would be someone with a strong passion for programming, interest in the whole web technology stack, interest in the philosophy and details of actually making web products work (deployment, testing, as well as dev management and principles). The ideal candidate wants to “own” big pieces of the vision and functionality. We’re very interested in (but not limited to) people who identify themselves as “full stack” developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a coding position, you’ll be a core member of the technology team, deeply involved in both the design and implementation of our technology. Our stack is mostly Javascript and Python using a lightweight, open source, semi-custom framework but our search is not limited to “python people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culturally, we’re low-ego and friendly, but super passionate about what we do. We’re looking for someone who is as passionate as we are and who strongly fits with the existing team. As a member of the core team, you’ll not only help us shape our technology and product, but will also help form the culture of our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you’re good with (or very interested in) these technologies
JavaScript, Python, Ruby, MySQL, AWS (or other cloud providers), Django, SQLAlchemy, Pylons, WSGI, NoSQL, memcached, REST design principles, API design and integration, async/concurrent IO programming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boston:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re based right in the middle of the Boston/Cambridge tech scene with hundreds of startups, over 500 regular tech and programming meet-ups and events, and tens of thousands of smart, motivated people building cool, innovative products. Boston is a great place to live and work, with a rich startup and technology ecosystem. If you’re not already in Boston, reach out and we’ll tell you more about why this is the perfect place for a developer to build their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smarterer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smarterer scores digital, social, and technical skills using crowdsourced test design and an adaptive scoring algorithm. In the past year, Smarterer users have taken more than 1.9 million tests and answered almost 20 million questions.  Our vision: Become the global standard in skills measurement. The opportunity? Huge!  Smarterer is backed by Google Ventures and True Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Company Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion-io is the pioneer of a new storage memory platform that significantly improves the processing capabilities within a data center by moving process-critical, or active data closer to the CPU where it is processed. Called shared data decentralization, this significantly reduces latency while increasing data center efficiency. Fusion’s integrated hardware and software solutions leverage non-volatile memory for enterprise-grade performance, reliability, availability and manageability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2006 by a management team with experience in transaction processing, high-performance networking, storage, superclusters, and computing and image processing, Fusion-io recognized that mechanical storage architectures do not keep pace with advances in digital processing power. This meant that despite major advances in technology, data processing was limited to the speed of legacy storage infrastructures. Without a solution designed to maximize their capabilities, modern CPUs sit idle while they wait for data to process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion-io solves the data supply problem with a new purpose-built solution. By combining hardware and software to develop a reliable storage memory platform, Fusion-io gives servers native access to data to accelerate enterprise databases and applications. This allows enterprises to significantly reduce complex and expensive high performance storage, high performance networking, and memory-rich servers.In addition to accelerating performance, Fusion’s storage memory platform also reduces energy consumption and total cost of ownership&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails Developer at ZOLL in Broomfield, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between this job and being a super hero? Both involve saving lives, but we actually pay you.
We are the leader for management and training of life saving devices such as defibrillators. We have the resources and stability of a large company, but the nimbleness, ambition, and determination of a startup, because we used to be one.
We have a small, highly motivated team and the most important thing is to be a demonstrated self-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we have to offer you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention super hero? Our office is casual enough you could wear a super hero costume, although shorts and flip flops may be more appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectually engaging discussions about software architecture among self-proclaimed experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciation that the work you do makes us a better company (mostly in the form of a competitive salary and benefits, but could also include cookies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mean what we say &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies for three consecutive years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Fortune&amp;rsquo;s list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for from you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super hero like ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails coding skills that would make DHH proud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly insatiable appetite to solve difficult problems fast, which may mean the fewest CPU cycles or developer cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok, and maybe some technical prowess with Git/Github, TDD, Postgres, OSX, Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design/front-end skills are a big plus &amp;ndash; particularly standards-based clean, maintainable markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of humor, because really, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t this all be fun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at 9mmedia in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Love what you do? So do we, which is why 9mmedia has been building amazing things for over 10 years now. We mostly work with startups, and our culture mostly resembles a startup &amp;ndash; well, only the good parts, that is. We are a group of 20ish passionate, smart, nice, fun people who all love working together in our gorgeous NYC office. We’ve worked hard to create an inspiring space and culture that combines the best of both worlds &amp;ndash; the interesting technological challenges and excitement of a startup, and the stability and comfort of a lifestyle business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our clients are our partners, so if you like being an integral part of developing and starting businesses, you’ll love how we operate. We have a small handful of projects going at any given time, and you’ll get the opportunity to work on many projects over the years, each with its own unique challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all that sounds good, we’d love to hear from you! We believe in giving all developers a lot of responsibility and control over what they do, and in treating people with trust and respect. We have no middle management, and you can make your own hours &amp;ndash; and no, that isn’t code for us expecting you to be in the office 24/7. We only care about people who can work hard, produce great apps, and get things done. You’ll get to learn lots of new technology, enhance your skills, and have a ton of influence over every product you touch here. We are looking for the sort of person who will speak up to help improve not only our products, but also our process, our technology and our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Skills &amp;amp; Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a great iOS developer you already know what we’re looking for, but one must observe the forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid command of the iOS SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cocoa / Objective-C proficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example code or working iOS app we can evaluate&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Senior User Experience Designer at Netflix in Los Gatos, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, designer!
Acquisition requires a unique skill that you have. You know how to inform and entice all while keeping it simple. You understand how to create a campaign across the globe. You know and understand how to draw people in with just the right amount of context. Do you have ideas how to communicate Netflix’s offer to the world? We want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re truly talented—recognized among your peers as the best. Your portfolio inspires and impresses other designers. Frankly, it also makes them a little jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an innovator by nature.  You “think” AND “do”. You’re smart, confident, highly competent—and mature enough not to have an ego. You’re a skilled communicator who welcomes honest, candid feedback. You believe that the best designs prove themselves in the marketplace, and you think of data and testing as allies in creating the best possible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have exceptional visual skills, and impeccable sensibility for color, composition, form and story. You’re a genius at solving interactive problems—and you’re passionate about exploring new frontiers in web, TV and mobile interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is an especially exciting time to join our design team. We’re growing rapidly and we have multiple openings. If you’re ready to add your vision—to imagine an alternate future—this is a rare opportunity. The things you discover and create will have widespread impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a place where talented, curious people come together to share ideas and solutions. Although Netflix is an established company, in many ways we still act like a start up, allowing us to act quickly on emerging business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we find the right people, we value them deeply—our compensation, benefits, and culture are hard to beat. We also believe creativity comes from happy, fearless and energetic individuals—so we’re serious about a healthy life-work balance and a comfortable, casual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Must Haves:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years design on consumer-friendly interactive experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great portfolio that showcases deep visual and interaction design skills?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to rapidly produce multiple UX/UI concepts ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication skills to clearly articulate your concepts—and evangelize on their behalf?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across the entire product lifecycle and have lived through multiple launches (experience with international launches is a plus)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BA/BS in fine arts, graphic arts, human factors or related field ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good sense of humor ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A love of movies and TV shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at MarkIT X in Chicago, IL</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;MarkITX is looking for a front-end developer to join our team. We want colleagues who are smart and get things done, who are inveterate builders, tinkerers and detectives. We hire people not experience levels, so we have a place for you whether you have built your own MVC framework or are fresh out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $20MM in orders and over $150k per week in transactions, roughly doubling every month. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best consumer web apps have far surpassed the best enterprise apps in terms of user experience. Our enterprise users are accustomed to absolutely horrible user experiences with existing options. This gives us a massive opportunity to wow our users with the kind of consumer-grade experience they’re getting used to out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We Expect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re more excited about what you can learn, than by what you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can take a project from problem, through ideas and user testing to implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with a startup, and all that entails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a set of tools that you know intimately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re happy to give and receive thoughtful criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will quickly get comfortable with our Node.js, Backbone, Handlebars, LESS, Brunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve used a VCS, and can quickly get comfortable with Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll commit to production on your first day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can move with the right team around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;We Provide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team of world-class sales, marketing, engineering, design, data and operations experts who are excited to teach you, and to learn from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A top-level commitment to open source. We publish and contribute, and you will too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An amazing work environment at 1871, the heart of Chicago’s digital startup ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A competitive compensation package, including equity participation and health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

As a member of our UX team, you will work collaboratively with the product management and development teams to transform functional/business specifications into highly polished, intuitive UIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position affords opportunities to work across a broad range of UX-related disciplines, from UI prototyping and interaction design, to usability testing and information architecture. The ideal candidate will be a well-rounded UX generalist who combines outstanding design skills with strong analytical, technical, and problem-solving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Job Functions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product managers to understand complex functional requirements and transform them into detailed design specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate design recommendations using wireframes, flowcharts, high-fidelity design comps, interactive prototypes, and the occasional cocktail napkin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create production-ready assets (icons, application themes, etc.) using design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Expression Blend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocate for the needs of end-users throughout the product design process; evangelize &amp;amp; promote good design principles and best practices throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independently manage multiple, concurrent projects in a fast-paced development environment, proactively ensuring that appropriate UX considerations are made throughout the SDLC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with project stakeholders to build consensus behind the best practical (not always the best possible) design solutions; produce final design specs that balance development deadlines and implementation costs against key design considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform UX reviews for projects in active development to ensure that they adhere to design specifications and established style guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize and facilitate small-scale usability tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help define, document, and communicate formal style guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum 4-year degree (B.S. or B.A.), ideally in a related field (design, HCI, human factors, computer science, technical writing, psychology, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-3 years of experience designing, developing, or documenting complex software solutions for the web or desktop environments; mobile design experience is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite; working knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough understanding of fundamental design principles and usability heuristics; ability to articulate the reasoning behind design decisions and communicate effectively with non-designers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototyping experience strongly preferred — e.g. familiarity with WPF, XAML, C#, Expression Blend, Flash, Cocoa, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, or similar. We currently use WPF/XAML for the bulk of our prototyping work. At a minimum, the successful candidate will be tech-savvy, curious, and motivated to learn new skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to create polished, professional designs that anticipate and accommodate the needs of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume, and a portfolio of recent design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Benefits:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensation includes a competitive base salary, performance bonus, 401K matching &amp;amp; excellent benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal candidate will have real passion for the web and always keeps an eye on emerging technologies. You will be working closely in a team of highly skilled web developers that are scattered across the United States. If you can design it, they can make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong web design portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s degree in something (if it’s something related to graphic/interactive design, even better!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience designing for client needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of HTML/CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX) principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written &amp;amp; verbal communication skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and practice web standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work on multiple projects is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with a modern CMS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with JavaScript / jQuery / YUI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of HTML5/CSS3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with PHP would be nice, but not expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know your way around Basecamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are used to keeping detailed, client-friendly time records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a dribbble.com account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Work Environment:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta builds award winning websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta Systems employees exemplify professionalism in every aspect of client relations and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Share your opinions and insights with business leaders on a daily basis in order to affect rapid decision cycles and effective solutions to business requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Benefits:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid by the hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex time – If you like working from 7am to 3pm or 3pm to 11pm great!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Development environments: Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac, whichever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll pay for applicable certification exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription to O’Reilly Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy “Virtual Tuesdays”; you can work from anywhere you want without meeting interruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dress is casual – jeans and t-shirts are just fine. When meeting with clients, we expect business appropriate attire and demeanor.&lt;/li&gt;

Our company, with offices in California and Oregon, designs and builds world-class interactive products for brand name clients across a broad range of industries. Every team member has the opportunity to work with a variety of platforms (Web, iOS, Windows 8, Xbox, Android) and clients, each one presenting a unique creative challenge. At Vertigo we work in a multi-disciplinary approach. Our engineering practice understands the exceptional value that good design brings to the products we build – you will see your design ideas implemented in the final product pretty much as you intended. And we ship or launch 99.9% of what we start. That’s pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What We’re Looking For&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost you are passionate about solving real-world visual design challenges. But of course you have a solid knowledge of visual design skills, processes and deliverables and know how to apply them to interactive products. You love color, typography, and a good sketch, and you’re willing to push creative boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a creative visual thinker who can successfully plan and prioritize your work, but you’re at your best in collaborative team environments. You have strong communication skills and can clearly articulate your design concepts to internal teams and clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how to shepherd your designs through the project lifecycle from hand sketch to final artwork. You pay close attention to detail and you’re willing to iterate, refine and polish the design to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you love working with smart, talented, fun people in a creative atmosphere of collaboration doing the best work possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of typography, color, layout, data visualization, and brand systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for application-specific contexts – UI controls, iconography, device resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of common visual design tools – pencils to pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for iOS, Android, modern web standards and Microsoft platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to facilitate or participate in design ideation sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work productively with engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the needs of a consulting business: time, scope and budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to  Scrum or Agile development methodologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client consulting experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing desire to learn and to share what you know with your colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction design or web development skills are a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with motion graphics or animation a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please include a link to an online portfolio in your resume.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at Zaarly in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Zaarly is changing how the economy works. That&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;hellip; just a little global economic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zaarly enables people to ask for anything from people nearby. A simple idea; but when it takes root in a community, the impact is profound. Buyers decide what they want and the price they want to pay and someone from the community makes it happen, creating a job and keeping money local. Zaarly helps anyone invest directly into their local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we’re a tech company, but what we&amp;rsquo;re building helps people change their community.  These are big ideas requiring enormous talent, borderline fanaticism and maybe a small dose of insanity. We&amp;rsquo;ve got an amazing team with the right mix.  Let&amp;rsquo;s do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a geek at heart, and you dream in mobile. You download apps from the App Store to dissect them and figure out how they were built. You ache to be part of a startup where your work is front and center. You&amp;rsquo;re tired of working on boring projects that you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in. You&amp;rsquo;re ready to work with a team that is doing something big, something worthwhile, something ridiculously cool. Right on! You&amp;rsquo;re hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architect, build and maintain the Zaarly iPhone app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new, exciting features and push code to hundreds of thousands of iPhone Zaarly users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up-to-date on the latest iPhone SDK developments, respond to customer feedback &amp;amp; testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience developing native iPhone apps or other mobile apps is strongly preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong Objective-C skills (Ruby and C/C++/ are a plus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An eye for great design and user experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passionate about quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate within a close-knit team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard-working and a fast learner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have one or more iPhone apps published in the App Store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Nice-to-Have’s:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager at StyledOn in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;StyledOn.com is a VC-backed startup based in NY and LA focused on creating the largest style centric social network — we are well on our way, but we need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a marriage of fashion and technology. If this sounds appealing to you, check our current openings and see if your skill set matches. However, if you don’t see something that matches your skills or tickles your fancy, and you think you are good enough for us to create a job for you, we invite you to send us your resume with an email on why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all busy here at StyledOn, so don’t send us fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more creative, the more thoughtful, the better your chances! Email positions@styledon.com with your proposed title in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How we define Product Management:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Management brings our ideas to fruition. This takes a supernatural ability to be both technical and creative, and, most importantly, to project manage to successful launch. StyledOn is creating a social network that is laser focused on “style”, and we are looking for individuals who are masters at creating, managing, and nurturing both online social mediums and mobile products. Product management is our guiding light as to what our market wants/craves/needs and helps our marketing department in positioning, packaging, and promoting the products that are created—after all, no one is more passionate than the creator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The role: Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StyledOn is looking for a Product Jedi Master. We are in the troughs of re-launching our online properties and creating our mobile applications and we need a hard-nosed, battle-tested technologist who knows how to bring to market a hatched idea. He/she needs to be ambitious and self-managed with a proven track record of defining, creating and managing market leading interactive products in a consumer-facing environment. We employ both internal shared resources and outsourced development houses to accomplish our product goals, so we are looking for someone who also has experience managing a diverse development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities boiled down:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a deep understanding of the competitive landscape in our vertical through analysis, user research and site testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead usability tests, feasibility studies, review web analytics and conduct user research to deliver high-quality products that meet user needs, or, better yet, create new user “needs”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own and manage every aspect of the product lifecycle and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly define requirements at a functional and technical level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope project strategies, initiatives, budgets and resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop project plan and resource allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain overall product and feature roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and present hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and feature concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, monitor and report progress against key success metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate product strategies and objectives into specific tactical plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, most importantly, EXECUTE on plan and hit timelines and targets!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BA/BS in Computer Science or a related technical field preferred (MS or Ph.D is a plus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of 5-8 years of product design and management experience in web-based businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in working on online content businesses, and in particular, experience in building online communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in product design and management of mobile products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product management record (e.g. writing MRDs and PRDs, performing competitive analysis, creating product roadmaps, creating presentations that communicate product features &amp;amp; benefits, defining user interfaces, creating wireframes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical thinker with exceptional verbal and written skills; this individual is the communication hub of product-related matters and must be able to communicate effectively with different roles in the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong business acumen and grasp of business fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical, organizational, and problem solving skills with ability to interpret data into key learnings and product strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter and team player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of comfort with working closely with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High integrity and a record of excellence in your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A true passion for product design and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the “social sphere” space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and oral communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent organizational and analytical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong technical abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in project managing outsourced development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;How to apply:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive hundreds of resumes and we can’t read them all. If you are interested in this position, and consider your skill set a good fit, do more than just send us your resume. If you are serious about being considered and want us to spend our time in reviewing your qualifications, then you should spend your time in presenting to us why you are a good fit. Include in your email something, anything that separates you from the crowd. Get creative! Get inventive! Give us your ideas of a product roadmap. Tell us where we are falling short. Give us your idea on a mobile app. We dare you to come up with something that makes us salivate so we can’t wait to hire you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email positions@styledon.com with “Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager” in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior Operations Developer at Aweber Communications in Chalfont, PA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Role:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senior Operations Developer role focuses on pushing forward efforts in system automation and deployment using tools like Chef and Puppet, building REST APIs using Python frameworks like Flask and Tornado, and researching new solutions to help drive platform innovation in any part of the organization. The role also participates in many other initiatives, not the least of which is solidifying and furthering our commitment to collaboration and cooperation between development and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A sampling of the types of projects performed by this role might include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building out event-oriented message queuing architectures to increase efficiency and open data streams to multiple applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and/or build new solutions to provide new services and functionality to the internal application platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate and expand the collection and use of metrics, leveraging new &amp;amp; existing tools to provide visualizations to both business and technical parts of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;You:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an experienced engineer. You’ve worked on multiple projects in various environments. You’ve put things into production, you’ve had people use them, you’ve failed, you’ve succeeded, you’ve paid your dues, and learned your lessons. You have a passion for technology, and view what you do as a craft. You like your job, but love your work. It’s something you’d do (and have done) even if there were no money or job involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You enjoy working with open source languages, toolchains, systems, and databases, and are always seeking out new solutions to difficult problems. Where those solutions are found lacking, you contribute, and occasionally build your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cringe at the thought of having to make a definitive choice between doing only software engineering or only systems engineering. You like to have your hands in all of it, and to be able to understand and affect change to any part of your work, front end to back end. You strongly resist pigeonholing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thrive in environments where technological and innovative velocity is high, and the overhead from administrivia is low. You can work well in isolation, but are happy to collaborate in a team setting, and might not even mind doing the occasional pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWeber’s engineering team is a dynamic and exciting place to be. We use open source technologies like PostgreSQL, Python, MongoDB, Redis, Riak, Chef, Ruby, Graphite, and RabbitMQ. We use approaches to software quality like Test-Driven Development, Continuous Deployment, and a healthy addiction to metrics that give us insight into our applications, and how well they’re serving our customers. We have a mode of execution built around Kanban, and a Kaizen culture of continuous improvement. We believe in the kind of transparency, processes, data sharing, collaboration, and communication that foster a DevOps culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid PPO medical, dental, vision, insurance. (including domestic partner benefits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Short Term Disability Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Life Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuition reimbursement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully Reimbursed Gym Memberships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 weeks paid time off  (plus increases in paid time off)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid holidays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;401K retirement benefits with company match and profit sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free lunches everyday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break rooms stocked with soda, juices, coffee and teas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro laptops and 30&quot; monitors for all development team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple high definition theater rooms fully equipped with xbox, wii &amp;amp; blu-ray players&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work must be beautiful, usable, and tell a story. We love digging into complex and messy problems because that&amp;rsquo;s our opportunity to tease a little order out of the chaos. We work with other designers, developers, financial analysts, and our clients to set new standards for information design. This work is widely used, billions of views each day (that’s billion, with a ‘b’), so what you do here matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exciting, right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a team of over 30 designers, and as business continues to grow, so do we. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for people who can create compelling experiences, who live and die by the grid, and who can see a story in a thousand data points. The skills we employ include everything from user research, information architecture and wireframes to pixel-perfect interactive comps. We hope Adobe Creative Suite is an extension of your hands, you know enough CSS to be dangerous and maybe even play around in Processing from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Still interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This might be your kind of place if you&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think design lies in the intentionally imperfect union of form and function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can tell us a story through numbers alone. Or chopsticks for that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovered Tufte and realized you weren&amp;rsquo;t alone in your obsession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Oh, and us? How nice of you to ask. We&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t love cubicles. Or barriers of any kind really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blush when clients call us data geeks, or tell us we&amp;rsquo;re detail obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are equally fascinated by Radiolab and Planet Money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;On top of the good stuff like competitive salaries, health insurance, and 401k, there's…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting paid to bike, bus or carpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlimited chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time to work on what you want (like that crazy idea you have been dreaming about for months).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;So if you think you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit here, send us…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your résumé. We need to see how well you color inside the lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your portfolio, Dribbble link or any other work examples. Coloring outside the lines is encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a link to your favorite data visualization and what about it resonates with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Help develop, manage, and refine UI pattern libraries and interaction guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate with developers through implementation phase to realize design vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate, defend, and build consensus around experience architecture and interaction design direction&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who deeply understands the bleeding edge of the Apple frameworks from the bare metal on up to the higher level APIs? Are you outrageously detail oriented? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible with iOS since late 2008 with mobile computer vision apps like RedLaser (acquired by eBay in 2010) and 360 Panorama. We&amp;rsquo;re not just an &amp;ldquo;app company.&amp;rdquo; We strive to change the world through our products and their underlying state-of-the-art computer vision technology, all of which is built from scratch by our broadly-talented team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need someone who knows exactly what the Apple iOS SDK is doing under the covers and can help us build innovative computer vision applications the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the text of an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough knowledge of memory management on iOS is ingrained in you. You can optimize the memory footprint of an app, avoid memory leaks like the plague, and you know what NSZombieEnabled is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can recite the exact setup / teardown process that UIKit follows for UIViewController and UIViews in your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve worked with AV Foundation, know what YCbCr is, and perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve even written a camera-based application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built a game or other graphics-based app using Open GL ES 2.0 and think pixel shaders are the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built an app that is live on the App Store that we can try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well compensated. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When you see a terrible UI do you have a hundred ideas on how you could do it better? Does creating next-gen user experiences get you out of bed in the morning? Are you so detailed oriented that an unwanted single pixel offset bugs you? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Occipital, we love creating amazing user-experiences on the web that work for all common browsers, but we also love pushing the envelope with the latest tech. With 360 Panorama, for example, we created an interactive viewer that works across almost every browser, but we also added gyro support for the mobile safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve just started scratching the surface of what’s possible with the font-end web, and we will do a lot more. The experiences we create around our computer vision powered products are brand new and require next-gen interfaces &amp;ndash; we want someone who can help us bring these experiences to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the size of a text field, even if that reason is that it looks better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience above all else &amp;ndash; You’ll deal with things like browser compatibility issues in an elegant way to make sure users on all popular browsers have a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an active Github account and can show us some code you are proud of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can tap into a user’s sensorimotor cortex to create Natural User Interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable Javascript and know when to use libraries like jQuery and when to just write something custom for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve built something with WebGL and have tons of ideas on how to take advantage of it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You believe 3D is a big part of the future, and you like to subtly integrate it into normal 2D web experiences, but then go all out when you’ve got HTML5 and WebGL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience building something non-trivial using Flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to join the team that’s building the future of Augmented Reality.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Director Customer Support at Hulu in Los Angeles, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Hulu Support team is dedicated to providing customer support so awesome that it will make users’ heads spin. Seriously. Our goal is to be the absolute best in the world at what we do, and this is a challenge we do not take lightly. We send emails in prose, tweet troubleshooting steps in less than 140 characters, and answer calls so fast users haven’t realized the phone was ringing. We call this “the support we wish we got everywhere else”, and as we go about providing it, we’re looking for a Director of Customer Support to help us take our goals to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a creative and exciting technology company that is on a strong growth trajectory &amp;mdash; we&amp;rsquo;ve been ahead of expectations in all measures of success since our founding in 2007. We pride ourselves on adding people to the team who can perform at a high level while exercising impeccable judgment. You know the type – they are intellectually curious, relentless in their pursuit of better ways, and possess an atypically high attention to detail. We trust them to do the right thing, give them the resources necessary to do so, and try to have some fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Director of Customer Support, you will be reporting to the VP of Product Development. While you will assume leadership of current day-to-day activities, your mission will be to establish Hulu as the customer support organization others want to replicate. This challenge will involve managing the continued growth of the organization, refining the customer support strategy, scaling to additional locations in the US, and building the tools and processes needed to implement that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other core responsibilities will include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exemplifying the Hulu culture on a daily basis, and fostering it in your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining and driving the ongoing development of Hulu&amp;rsquo;s customer support strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing on continual improvement of self-help and live-support tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping each team member grow and develop, while merging individual players into a motivated and passionate team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing the CSA leadership team, and mentoring in core management skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying and communicating key feedback trends to Product and Development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring and training the right people to grow a high performing customer support team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing quality of service metrics that ensure a premium-quality customer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Leading from the front&amp;rsquo; by pitching in and responding to customer contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remaining flexible in your schedule, as we intend to provide 24/7 support in the next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just anyone gets to be part of Hulu. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a proven leader who has developed and motivated people, and shaped strong performing teams. While experience working in media and/or technology companies is helpful, we think it&amp;rsquo;s also valuable to have had exposure to multiple industries. Of course it will help to have experience building and scaling CS teams, but just as important, you must demonstrate rabid passion for customers and an understanding that customer support is really both a form of direct marketing and a valuable source of product feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in managing, mentoring and motivating high-performing teams in a constructive manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence, high energy, and a proven ability to drive results under pressure and in the face of ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analytical mindset and a relentless drive to find innovative ways to improve processes and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid understanding of web technology and support challenges in the tech industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of call center operations and best practices, but also the ability to develop a team that can resolve issues without relying on scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with multiple support channels, including an understanding of the scalability and cost effectiveness of web channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing multiple support locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A background in marketing and turning customers into brand ambassadors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUESTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think you’ve got what it takes? Well, Pop Quiz Hotshot, please take a minute to answer the next two questions, and send them in along with your resume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Question 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are brief descriptions of two scenarios someone might have as a customer out in “the real world”. Please choose one of them, put yourself in the shoes of that person, and write a review about what the experience was like (something like a Yelp review). There’s no right or wrong scenario to choose, so don’t spend too much time psychoanalyzing your choice. All we ask is that you keep your response shorter than 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scenario A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting a new doctor’s office for the first time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The receptionist at the front desk was snooty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You arrived on time, but had to wait 47 minutes until the doctor saw you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doctor was super friendly, and had amazing bedside manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only available parking garage cost $15 per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were promised test results by the next day, but never received them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Scenario B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking out the brand new restaurant on the block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You walked in at 7PM on a Friday night, and were quoted a 45 minute wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The host was super friendly and apologetic for the long delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 5 minutes, the manager found you outside to let you know a table had opened up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During your meal, the server delivered the wrong drink order (twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the check came, you noticed the drinks had been taken off the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now picture this. You’re managing a team of CSAs, but decide to jump in the queue to stay current on customer contacts. Please write what you would consider to be the ideal response to the following customer&amp;rsquo;s questions. Basically, rock their world like you’d expect your team to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Hulu,
I recently became a Hulu Plus subscriber but I have two quick questions. First, even though I&amp;rsquo;m paying, why am I still seeing commercials that stutter? Secondly, will I be able to watch all the episodes of The Big Bang Theory and The Office on my TV and iPhone at the same time with Hulu Plus?
Thanks for your help!
Bucky&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Back-End Web Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to push the boundaries of what’s possible in web technology to help build the future of augmented reality? Are you able to hold a complete understanding of a complex backend system in your head to build fast and reliable web applications and APIs? Do you have a deep understanding of how networking, databases, and servers work down to the bare metal? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re creating a computer vision platform to power the next generation of augmented reality. This is an incredibly complex endeavor that will require everything from sophisticated computer vision algorithms running on mobile devices, to vast storage of visual information, to taking advantage of GPU servers for fast parallel image processing. An important part of this platform will be the web backend system required to tie it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our currently launched product, 360 Panorama, has millions of users and huge potential that we have yet to tap. 360 Panorama users are helping us build the 360VERSE &amp;ndash; a way to explore the world through 360 views, searchable by location AND time (currently in beta, launching soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a web wizard who is excited to help us expand on 360 Panorama and 360VERSE and also help us build the computer vision platform that will usher in a new wave of augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If you have experience with most of the following, we’d love to talk to you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python or other server side scripting language experience (most of our backend is written in Python)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC frameworks (we use Django)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js (used on our GPU servers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres or other SQL experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geospatial / location search using PostGIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*nix server administration and automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of cloud services, including storage and server provisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of front-end technologies (e.g. Javascript, HTML5, WebGL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and ability to debug the full web stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of networking protocols and ability to implement and design new ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Web Developer/Front-End Engineer at AppFolio in Goleta, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to build software that matters? Do you want to work with a brilliant engineering team that really cares that users love their software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppFolio is a fast growing and funded startup in Santa Barbara, CA that is focused on building exciting web-based business applications that customers rave about. We take pride in finding new ways to delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will join our engineering team to design and build user interfaces that are used millions of times each month and help to make people&amp;rsquo;s lives a little bit better. Although all our engineers work across the entire development stack, we are looking to hire specialists specifically in the front-end who can provide expert level guidance to our team and stay on top of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We are looking for people with expert-level proficiency in:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (and libraries like jQuery, Modernizr, Backbone, Underscore, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-browser support and progressive enhancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Inspector/Firebug including the JavaScript debugger and web console&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Expert-level proficiency means:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You follow industry leaders and the latest w3 specs to stay on the cutting edge of new technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve downloaded and installed nightly builds of Chrome, Webkit, and Firefox just to try out new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t just use JavaScript libraries, you know how they work. You’ve probably submitted patches to popular libraries or even built your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML semantics is important to you; you’d never have a hard time deciding between using a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;ul&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a solid understanding of CSS selector specificity and you don’t resort to just adding another ID to make one rule trump another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;If you have one or more of the skills below, even better:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Ruby on Rails or similar MVC application framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with SASS, Compass, CoffeeScript or other language preprocessors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Pair programming and green tests make the day fly by with the gratification of clean code without broken windows. Our analytics module runs in EC2, hitting nginx, aggregating all data into our sharded MongoDB database. Like to map/reduce over extremely large data sets? Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG is seeking a Sr. PHP Developer to augment our progressive team of engineers. The position is for long term contract (6+ months) with intent to move to a permanent position within our company. The project we are hiring for could quite possibly be one of the coolest projects you have ever worked on. It combines front-end development with hardware integration within the entertainment industry. EMG will be using a true agile sprint planning process. This position is one among a project team of 4+ developers for this particular project. There will also be a mid-level PHP developer that you will work side-by-side with. No matter what level of engineer you are hired as, there is an expectation that you will teach and learn from your peers and teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG offers a wide array of technical projects to work on in various languages and platforms, each with a different challenge. Our environment is set up so that our developers can touch a little bit of everything for their own experience, and that also enables EMG to deliver high quality products for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All employees of EMG must be positive with a “can do” attitude. The ability to understand risks and time/scope implications and be able to communicate those to your Director of Technology is required. There is not one person at EMG that does not have an entrepreneurial spirit. We work hard and play hard, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position requires the developer to work at EMG offices throughout this project’s duration on EMG supplied hardware. EMG offices are currently located in Culver City, CA. We will be moving to our new home towards the end of Q3 2012 which is at the Hercules Campus nearly 10 minutes from the current location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Job Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Candidate will have:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8+ years overall professional software development experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of PHP development experience (preferably recent experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with a relational database (preferably MySQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with design principles (patterns, cohesion/coupling, S.O.L.I.D.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Agile engineering practices (test driven development, continuous integration and pair programming, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptional familiarity with object oriented development principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability (and enthusiasm) in mentoring less experienced developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Prefer candidates who additionally possess:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering web development, all layers, from database services to user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Oriented JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with eCommerce development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with high-volume web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the development, deployment, and enhancement of RESTful APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in a medium or large corporate environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Senior Designer at Designkitchen in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not that you draw on everything – let’s just say that your friends know to keep napkins away from you when you’re out and about and that they have to wear long sleeves to keep your ever-handy Sharpies at bay. You’ve got the eye, though, and why should you stop? It makes you happier than anything to bring an idea to life. And that’s why we’ve got a blank canvas here at Designkitchen for you to scribble away on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Senior Designer, you’ll consistently generate presentation-grade work with minimal direction, owing to your intimate knowledge of the client’s business motives and requirements as well as your uncompromising attention to detail. What’s more, we’ll expect you to take the lead in many creative projects, mentoring other designers, photographers, illustrators, writers, and vendors as the team moves towards innovative solutions for a diverse array of clients. For this reason, you must have excellent collaborative and multitasking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll present work directly to clients, so brush up on those communication skills. An expert in design software, you’ll also be expected to know your way around HTML/dHTML, CMS, CSS, Audio/Video and Flash within all web, mobile and tablet applications. At the top of our design team, we’ll need you to stay sharp on trends and take the initiative to wow our clients with your napkin doodling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A couple keys to a successful Senior Designer…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across channels (digital, direct, print, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance and banking experience a plus but not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great concepter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great collaborator – works with Planning, UX, Content, Technology and Account teams to execute exceptional work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizational and time management skills – can work on multiple projects and manage multiple deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to inspire teamwork and take a leadership role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic understanding of HTML5/dHTML, CSS, CMS, audio/video, mobile and all flash capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert use of Photoshop and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompromising attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor and advise other designers, direct photographers, illustrators, writers, and/or other vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;About us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designkitchen is a creative digital agency and part of Wunderman, a subsidiary of Y&amp;amp;R (WPP).

				<title>UI Developer at awe.sm in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Why us: help solve hard problems that create real value for business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every website, mobile app, or marketing campaign has a social layer now, but too few companies make use of the incredibly valuable social data generated each day by their own users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm has built a powerful platform that captures these data, connects them to real business goals, and enables our customers to harness the results to create value through our growing toolset, robust APIs, and integrations with leading 3rd-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve proven the value of our technology to a growing number of real customers – from startups to the Fortune 500, and now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to grow our team, our capabilities, and the reach of our platform. Our goal is to help our customers harness the rich intent and effectiveness data from social interactions to build more compelling applications, produce more relevant content, and market more effectively – anywhere social is driving value, awe.sm can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the job: turning Big Data into Great Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are collecting enormous amounts of data, and are constantly coming up with new things we can do with it. Your job is to take the power of our APIs and focus it down into clear, easy-to-understand interfaces that help our customers see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and make use of that information to meet their goals. You&amp;rsquo;ll be extending our GUI as well as knocking out prototypes that demonstrate to customers all the ways they can use the data our platform can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to think creatively and come up with novel, illuminating interfaces that make the value of our data more obvious, easier, and more fun to use. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to be handing you a PSD and telling you to get all the pixels lined up; we&amp;rsquo;re going to be explaining a problem and looking to you for a solution that nobody&amp;rsquo;s tried before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who you are: excited just from the job description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an experienced developer with a proven track record of getting things done on the web. We&amp;rsquo;re also looking for someone deeply interested in user interface design and the presentation of information. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have built something in this area already, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a side project. We want somebody who uses JavaScript for more than form validation, and knows more than just jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all we&amp;rsquo;re looking for honest enthusiasm: does the idea of building big new things and having to learn a lot to get them done fill you with a burning desire to get started right away? Then you&amp;rsquo;re the person we need. We want somebody who has big ideas and the technical chops to bring them to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm works with hundreds of customers large and small, from startups like Zaarly, StockTwits, and Topspin Media to not-so-startups like Groupon, Zynga, and Gilt Groupe. We’re backed by leading VC firms and are expanding from a team of 5 to 10–15. The salary is competitive and comes with a generous stock option plan as well as full health, dental and vision coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a technology-driven business, we are creating an engineering-driven organization. Personal development is one of our highest company priorities, and we believe that technical development is essential to a strong engineering culture. That translates into code reviews and tech talks to promote learning and assigning projects in ways that help team-members explore their interests first-hand. We hope this will be your favorite job, but we doubt it will be your last and we want every member of our team to walk away from this experience better equipped to pursue their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current front-end code is mostly in PHP using the Zend Framework (we like MVC, but are not big fans of Ruby on Rails). We want somebody unafraid of learning new languages and APIs to get things done. Our user interface is HTML5 with a lot of Javascript for visualizations. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably be pleased to hear that we do not support IE 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a close-knit team. It should go without saying since we&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we work flexible hours in casual dress. We mostly work out of our offices on the 6th floor of the US Bank building in the Mission, featuring truly awesome views. We value our ability to concentrate, so we&amp;rsquo;re a pretty quiet room and everyone&amp;rsquo;s got headphones, but our IRC room is always active, with both technical arguments and the latest YouTube videos. We eat lunch together every day, and socialize after work regularly. We are increasingly good at throwing surprise birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buzzwords:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Must-haves:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML (including HTML5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (actual knowledge of the language, not just jQuery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-haves (in order of niceness):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC framework (especially Zend Framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook and Twitter APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Roles and responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Brafton Graphics Like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are passionate about information design and struggle to understand when numbers and stats are misrepresented. We research to discover narratives that become visually communicative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team our days revolve around deadlines, clients, team brainstorm sessions, critiques, a demanding schedule that values quality as much as turnaround and a workload that&amp;rsquo;s only for the strong. Oh and we also love puns and discovering narratives in random statistics. Still reading? Then we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of Boston&amp;rsquo;s Financial District, Brafton&amp;rsquo;s Graphics team has grown immensely since late 2011 when it was an army of two. Since then the team has grown to nine in total and with the influx of more work looks to add to that number. This is why the team has been one of the fastest growing and most innovating within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;THE JOB&lt;/h3&gt;

Our designers are required to be proficient in research, aware of trends in social media and open to various topics that can range from fashion to finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;YOUR ROLE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer collaborates with the Design Manager, clients and various internal departments. Ideal candidates will be able to spearhead high design standards, provide excellent customer service and work on a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORE RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer is tasked with project production and delivery, including (but not limited to) the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing internet-based primary research for infographics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-time delivery of graphics to clients. Missed deadlines will NOT be tolerated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponding with clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally formatting whitepapers, case studies, brochures and one-pagers for clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required Competencies/Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earned a Degree in Graphic Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Adobe Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop (We run on CS6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with interactive design methods: HTML5, Java, After Effects, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Salesforce is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with project management system Basecamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter with strong attention to detail, including proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Gmail/Google Docs&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Director, Planning and Strategy at WNET New York Public Media in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;American Masters, Thirteen/WNET’s award-winning biography series, celebrates our arts and culture. Created and launched in 1986 by Executive Producer Susan Lacy, the series set the standard for documentary film profiles, accruing widespread critical acclaim – 50 Emmy nominations and 23 awards – including for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 – the 2012 Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Producer of Non-Fiction Television; an Oscar, three Grammys and 12 Peabody Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Masters has produced an exceptional library of 180 titles, bringing unique originality and perspective to exploring the lives and illuminating the creative journeys of our most enduring writers, musicians, visual and performing artists, dramatists and filmmakers – those who have “left an indelible impression on our cultural landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the Executive Producer of American Masters, this newly created position is responsible for devising and implementing short- and long-range strategies for enlarging and stabilizing the American Masters franchise, with a senior role in both external and internal (WNET) initiatives and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director will be responsible for developing innovative thinking and forging relationships to further the reach and scope of the series beyond broadcast into the digital space, publishing, creative partnerships with universities, libraries and other organizations; for evaluating and activating renewed and original exploitation of the assets of the American Masters archive; for considering and planning new spin-offs, sub-sets, mini-series etc. based on existing and future American Masters programming &amp;ndash; all with an eye to maximizing the educational,digital, social media and revenue producing possibilities for both the existing library and future productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort will entail developing media and other creative partnerships&amp;mdash;both digital and analog, in film, production, literary and visual media&amp;mdash;as well as potential funding partners&amp;mdash;individuals, philanthropic and corporate&amp;mdash;including developing promotional tie-in and event opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director’s role will also entail coordination of all grant proposals to foundations, governmental organizations and PBS, collaborating closely with WNET Development staff. This individual will manage internal communications between the series and all relevant departments at WNET—the VP Programming, Interactive Engagement, Law, Human Resources, Station Relations, Communications, Program Publicity and especially Development and Major Gifts &amp;ndash;  and will be primarily responsible for working with Communications to coordinate press efforts, press releases and events, including screenings, station outreach events and the TCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the reach of the series through potential digital partnerships, this position will entail continued and expanded work with WNET&amp;rsquo;s in-house on-line and web department to enhance the work currently being done with the series programs, especially in the area of educational materials, DLOs etc. &amp;ndash; including finding the funding to support these expanded efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, candidates must possess a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff. Candidates must also have thorough knowledge of budgets and budget management; of rights and clearance issues; excellent oral and written communication skills; strong planning, organizational and relationship-building skills; knowledge of the independent production community; and ideally, some experience in fundraising. Familiarity with digital and online would be very desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidates with solid experience as executive or senior producer or in a development &amp;amp; planning role, in network, cable or independent production, with a successful history of developing projects, creating alliances, and fundraising – are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not a position for an active film-maker or would-be producer for American Masters – though film and production experience will be essential.  Rather, this is a critical senior administrative role in planning, strategy, communications and development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Required Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior UX Designer, Yammer Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, we work on a product that is changing people&amp;rsquo;s lives at work. We believe that everyone deserves to use software that is useable, simple, and beautiful, whether they use it in their personal lives or for work. Yammer empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent, more equal way of doing their jobs. To change more lives at more companies, we&amp;rsquo;re now a part of Microsoft, but we run independently &amp;ndash; and quickly &amp;ndash; in London and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us lead the London edition of Yammer&amp;rsquo;s User Experience Team as chief user advocate. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a critical part of every London feature from conception to launch, working constantly with product management, research, engineering, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need designers who are great communicators and problem solvers with dead-on interaction instincts, but who know how visual UI design can affect the experience. We need both concise wireframes, and flawless visuals, but we know that they are separate skills and not mutually exclusive to create the best experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead the UX design process for product features that will be released in London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice a highly efficient, iterative design process with light documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide interaction/visual specification with visual styling, wireframes, workflow diagrams, and interactive mockups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate frequently with the UX Team in San Francisco to keep consistency with the user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience (or comparable) at various companies designing great consumer facing or enterprise products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed and launched multiple products/major features/apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with cross-functional teams in a rapid paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of technology advantages and limitations required (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle or Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work experience with user research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide production ready files to engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited not daunted by the fact that designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-end Developer at Harvest in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The role that JavaScript plays at Harvest is growing every day. You&amp;rsquo;ll join our front-end team in solving problems, building new features and making Harvest better and better. If you have experience with a nimble team where things progress rapidly then you&amp;rsquo;ll feel right at home at Harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest is a distributed team. We have a lovely big office in New York City, but team members live all over the USA, Canada and Europe. Wherever you currently live, that&amp;rsquo;s where we want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we mention a sense of humor yet? It&amp;rsquo;s important, we like to have fun while we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unrivaled attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing some extra work to make life easier on the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like writing CoffeeScript, but can write vanilla js without breaking a sweat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Backbone and Ember and have an opion on what makes them good/bad/meh. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve even built projects in both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know that performance is king and have optimized your code for a wide range of browsers and platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write code in a modular, reusable fashion. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve released open source code that demonstrates these qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe that a task is not complete until a test is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;A Sample of Tasks and Projects You Might Work On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build new Harvest features and improve existing components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a select box plugin for use in Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a cross-platform framework to support the mobile web component of Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a state manager for CSS media queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please make sure you fit the descriptions above (see the brain!). You must be authorized to work in the United States (unless you intend to work remotely from your home country).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email us at careers@getharvest.com with the subject &amp;ldquo;Harvest Front-end Developer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to work with us, and why you&amp;rsquo;d make a good fit here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us your thoughts on the eternal JavaScript debate: semicolons &amp;ndash; yes or no?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer - Yammer (Mobile/Android) Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media has dramatically changed the way we share and connect with friends and family, and it will have an even more profound impact on the way companies operate. Yammer and Microsoft provide a secure, private social network for your company. Yammer empowers employees to be more productive and successful by enabling them to collaborate easily, make smarter decisions faster, and self-organize into teams to take on any business challenge. It is a way of working that naturally drives business alignment and agility, reduces cycle times, engages employees and improves relationships with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know devices are the future; come help us design the future of great work software on Android-powered devices. We&amp;rsquo;re building a product that empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent way of doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yammer team is located in San Francisco, and we maintain the intensity, pragmatism, and velocity of a startup. We release product weekly and projects last weeks, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is structured around designers who are flexible, but who specialize in either visual/UI or interaction/UX. Our UI designers translate wireframes into pixel-perfect, typographically beautiful, development-ready visuals. Your visual designs and ideas are an integral part of what makes a feature stick. You&amp;rsquo;ll be part of feature project teams from the beginning until launch, working side-by-side with a product manager, UX designer, researcher, engineering team, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-3 years’ experience working, preferably at more than one past company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated understanding of Android’s User Interface Guidelines through completed design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise working daily in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide visual specification and production ready files to engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited that their designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic and possibly a little bit weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eager to move to a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UIDesigner at Litmus in Cambridge, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re bootstrapped, profitable and proud. You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with our team of
developers building cool stuff, with amazing people. Here&amp;rsquo;s what some of our 11
person crew have to say about Litmus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone. Gives. A. Shit. (about the tech, the products, the customers, each other). Trust and ownership are important here. We build products that scratch our own itch. We experiment, we celebrate (big things (like throwing a launch party), and small (beers at the end of the week)). Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s no red tape, bullshit posturing, timecards or org charts!&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Eddie, Ruby Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aside from software architecture and syntax, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a task that I have begun that I have known how to do. It is a constant learning experience and we often times find ourselves building things that have never been built before.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justin, C# Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re in charge of our own future and aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden by a board, investors or anyone else. I feel like the people I work for care more for our customers and their employees than most other companies do.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justine, Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Super cool office! &amp;ndash; Our office is amazing and we do a lot of cool things here. Kinect + beer fridays + fun :) It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to get to and a great location.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Danielle, Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &quot;founders&amp;rdquo; are in the thick of it. Also, the collective responsibility, I feel like I could rely on any team member for help.&amp;ldquo;
&lt;strong&gt;James, Account Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About The Position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer everything you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cutting edge, financially successful start
up. Great salary, full health care benefits, 28 days paid vacation (yes, on top of
public holidays!), beautiful office space complete with a Kinect, beer fridge and
Sonos sound system. We also buy you lunch, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the very best money can buy: SSD drives, dual Apple
Displays, Aeron chairs, huge desks, 10&quot; tablets and whatever else you need to be
awesome at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention our office? Seconds from the Central Square T in Cambridge, we have the 11th floor to ourselves. Stunning views, beautiful furniture and top of the line equipment. You have to see it; it&amp;rsquo;s stunning. Design is a key selling point of our products. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone to take over responsibility for all aspects of design and user experience at Litmus. We&amp;rsquo;ll give you all the resources and support you need to craft beautiful, elegant experiences that delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing the user interfaces for all our web-based products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working closely with our development team to oversee the implementation of your designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-ordinating user testing of our product and your own prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping in to help with user experience decisions whenever they arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The ideal candidate has:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio showcasing excellent skills in design and UX principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of layout, typography, color and other design principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UI Engineer / FrontEndDeveloper at Hearsay Social in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who knows what makes a website look and behave well and also has the random set of skills to actually
make it happen. Someone who is so OCD that she even wants her code to look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who understands that there are living, breathing people at the other end of the tube. They’re impatient.
They read very little. Sometimes they use ancient devices that you wouldn’t touch with a 10 foot pole, but hey they’re your guests and you’re open-minded so you accommodate them. If they can’t figure something out, it&amp;rsquo;s not their fault; it&amp;rsquo;s your fault for building a confusing application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer you believe less is more. You deconstruct a page to its most crucial elements (after figuring out what the most crucial elements are). You show and don’t tell. You realize that we are building a business application and not (thank God) a consumer daily deal site. As such, our site should be timelessly elegant without being trendy. You are consistently consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you want every page to load in a snap. You know that all those &lt;strong&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/strong&gt; cause the browser to chug-a-lug so you use &lt;strong&gt;CSS3 for the bling and kiss the PNGs goodbye&lt;/strong&gt;. You have a visceral reaction to any text that’s part of an image (excepting, of course, logos) because you know it isn&amp;rsquo;t scalable or translatable. Your markup is clean and semantic. You know the difference between &lt;strong&gt;display block, inline and inline-block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what it’s good for but you also know when not to use it. You prefer the &lt;strong&gt;acronym XHR to the misnomer AJAX because it should really be called AJAJ&lt;/strong&gt;. You like to experiment with new paradigms like Backbone but ultimately know it’s just one of many different implementations; it’s the thing you’re implementing that’s important not the technology that gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You secretly know that front end development is harder than back end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-end Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful
ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing
channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way:
organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more
downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as
app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a
slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of
user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong
opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in
everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your
HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire
employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it&lt;/em&gt;. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part
of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying
customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to
becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well compensated&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation
package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome team&lt;/em&gt;. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include
sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Mobile Developer (Android &amp; iOS) at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Developer &amp;ndash; Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect of mobile and web games&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android development experience using cross platform tools. i.e. creating one code base that can be compiled for both Android and iOS on same platform a plus, e.g. use of LiveCode, Marmalade, Corona&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to take initiative to be productive and efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to work independently and within a team, depending on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires hands-on architecting, designing, and coding new features on IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate with team members in design reviews and code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of development experience in IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen Poker Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We currently have demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Serve as creative thought leader and primary hands-on producer for the Traveler Services business unit; ensure that the creative execution supports the creative brief, brand and business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage and direct any creative agencies, contract graphic designers, or production artists; set world-class quality standards in all creative deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Android and iOS Mobile Developers at CSC in Cincinnati, OH</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;CSC (www.csc.com), one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative and successful IT services firms, is looking for candidates to help grow our talented consulting team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for individuals who:
* Strive for excellence in everything they do
* Bring a partnering approach to their job
* Focus on the innovative use of technology to overcome business challenges
* Seek to work in a environment that respects individual ideas and diversity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we are seeking to hire Mobility developers with deep skills in Android to work with clients to design and deliver solutions that meet their specific business objectives. You will leverage and grow your knowledge and skills in a fast-paced, rewarding environment &amp;mdash; working side-by-side with our team of world class consultants.  In addition to a rewarding work environment, CSC offers an outstanding set of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a Sr. Android developer with 3 to 5 years of commercial experience in developing software solutions with a focus on user interface design.   Ideal candidate will have developed 10+ apps on a professional basis, either for individual sale or for enterprise customers. Experience in iOS and HTML5 development a big plus.  You will be working with a team of User Experience professionals and Solution Architects to deliver mobile application (BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company:  CSC (www.csc.com) is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading providers of information technology services, helping organizations achieve business results through the effective use of technology. Since its formation in 1959, CSC has earned a customer-centric reputation for developing and managing solutions specifically tailored to each client&amp;rsquo;s needs. No other company offers the same range of professional services and global reach as CSC does in areas such as business and technology strategies, management consulting, information systems consulting and integration, application software, and IT and business process outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSC is a leading provider of management and information technology services to commercial and government markets in over 90 countries.  Our consulting portfolio spans the full life cycle &amp;ndash; from strategy and business process design to technology services, systems integration, application outsourcing and hosting.  Our clients benefit from the breadth and depth of our global expertise, but more importantly, CSC goes to market using a team of local experts, creating a relaxed, professional-casual atmosphere, while maintaining a family and people-oriented culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we right for you?  CSC offers a variety of challenging opportunities that will draw on your talents while enabling you to grow your intellectual capital in a supportive environment.  Learning experiences are offered as a blend of relevant work assignments, training, tools, mentoring and other growth opportunities.  We offer many avenues to mastering your chosen profession, while giving you everyday exposure to brilliance in business, technology and people.  As one employee puts it &amp;ldquo;you have the freedom to explore different technologies, the mobility to move from one role to another (or one country to another), and the possibilities of learning from 92,000 colleagues worldwide &amp;ndash; without changing employer or losing benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career Advancement:  Your career belongs to you. At CSC, we recognize that you are in control of identifying and achieving your career goals.  CSC enables you to take the lead through our formal development planning process.  We will help you create a plan for enhancing your skills and experience by providing information, tools, and people that will support your career planning efforts.  We have identified over 60 standard roles that exist across CSC Consulting, as well as the corresponding skills needed to succeed in those roles.  You can use this information to identify your next assignment or an entire career path anywhere in the U.S. or potentially the world.  A career at CSC can be as targeted or eclectic as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectation for Travel:  For the Global Business Solutions division of CSC, all roles require a commitment to 100% travel.  This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a person will always be traveling for assignments, but new Consultants joining the CSC team need to understand that they could be assigned to a travel role.  The staffing process focuses on assigning people to local roles as a first priority, however, if a Consultant is available and has the right skills for an assignment for another CSC office across the United States, the Consultant may be staffed into that travel assignment.  When this happens, they travel to the project location at the start of the week, return at the end of the work week and are home during the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Below is the generic description for this position:&lt;/h2&gt;

				<title>Senior Applications Developer at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Sr. Applications Developer &amp;amp; Systems Specialist * Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect or advanced developer  of mobile or web games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands technology trade-offs for development platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience building native web and mobile apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced developing  with rich media and interactive web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with the majority of: JavaScript, HTML(5), CSS3, JSON, Jquery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced in object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recently demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a windows shop. However, ff you have an open source background and consider youself the agnostic type with a high stadard for making quality, scalable software, then we&amp;rsquo;d love to connect with and tell you more details surrounding the greatest technology challenge of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Funding &amp;amp; The Legalization of Online Poker in California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is underway and funded by a well-known and big Native American casino. This is an important point because the proposed law states that in order to run an online poker system you must already hold a gaming license in CA. The tribe will also provide the $35-40M required to obtain the license when the licensing process is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legalization of online poker in California is anticipated to be enacted in 2013 with the ability to open the online poker room either in late 2013 or early 2014. The bill for legalization is known as CA Senate Bill 51 which was introduced by Senator Roderick Wright on Dec 21, 2012. It was first introduced by on 2/24/12 as SB 1463 before being withdrawn several months later.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Developer at StudentsFirst in Sacramento, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a national grassroots movement of more than 2 million parents, teachers, students, administrators and concerned citizens mobilizing for one purpose: to put the laws and leaders in place to make students the focus of and ensure America has the best schools in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things the old way for too long.  Pitting the interests of the grown-ups in the system against one another, for example, rather than focusing on real solutions.  No one won. And students lost.  In too many American schools, current laws, policies, and practices are putting adult interests ahead of students. The result is an increasingly broken education system that, if not corrected, will keep America from leading in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new approach that puts students' interests at the center of education policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are channeling the energy of our members to produce meaningful results on both the local and national level. We are working with bipartisan state legislators to create laws and policies that put the needs of students above any other interest in the system. Our members are pushing for reforms that will elevate the teaching profession and improve teacher and principal quality, empower parents and improve the governance and financial strength of school districts. Together, we’ve already helped pass more than 50 new policies in half a dozen states. We have helped improve education systems affecting millions of students. We’re transforming public education to ensure great teachers and great schools for all of our kids. StudentsFirst was founded in 2010 by former Washington D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee.&lt;/p&gt;
