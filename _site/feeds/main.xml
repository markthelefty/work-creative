				<title>Senior UX Designer, Yammer Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, we work on a product that is changing people&amp;rsquo;s lives at work. We believe that everyone deserves to use software that is useable, simple, and beautiful, whether they use it in their personal lives or for work. Yammer empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent, more equal way of doing their jobs. To change more lives at more companies, we&amp;rsquo;re now a part of Microsoft, but we run independently &amp;ndash; and quickly &amp;ndash; in London and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us lead the London edition of Yammer&amp;rsquo;s User Experience Team as chief user advocate. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a critical part of every London feature from conception to launch, working constantly with product management, research, engineering, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need designers who are great communicators and problem solvers with dead-on interaction instincts, but who know how visual UI design can affect the experience. We need both concise wireframes, and flawless visuals, but we know that they are separate skills and not mutually exclusive to create the best experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead the UX design process for product features that will be released in London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice a highly efficient, iterative design process with light documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide interaction/visual specification with visual styling, wireframes, workflow diagrams, and interactive mockups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate frequently with the UX Team in San Francisco to keep consistency with the user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience (or comparable) at various companies designing great consumer facing or enterprise products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed and launched multiple products/major features/apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with cross-functional teams in a rapid paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of technology advantages and limitations required (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle or Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work experience with user research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide production ready files to engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited not daunted by the fact that designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-end Developer at Harvest in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The role that JavaScript plays at Harvest is growing every day. You&amp;rsquo;ll join our front-end team in solving problems, building new features and making Harvest better and better. If you have experience with a nimble team where things progress rapidly then you&amp;rsquo;ll feel right at home at Harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest is a distributed team. We have a lovely big office in New York City, but team members live all over the USA, Canada and Europe. Wherever you currently live, that&amp;rsquo;s where we want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we mention a sense of humor yet? It&amp;rsquo;s important, we like to have fun while we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unrivaled attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing some extra work to make life easier on the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like writing CoffeeScript, but can write vanilla js without breaking a sweat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Backbone and Ember and have an opion on what makes them good/bad/meh. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve even built projects in both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know that performance is king and have optimized your code for a wide range of browsers and platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write code in a modular, reusable fashion. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve released open source code that demonstrates these qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe that a task is not complete until a test is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;A Sample of Tasks and Projects You Might Work On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build new Harvest features and improve existing components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a select box plugin for use in Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a cross-platform framework to support the mobile web component of Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a state manager for CSS media queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please make sure you fit the descriptions above (see the brain!). You must be authorized to work in the United States (unless you intend to work remotely from your home country).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email us at careers@getharvest.com with the subject &amp;ldquo;Harvest Front-end Developer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to work with us, and why you&amp;rsquo;d make a good fit here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us your thoughts on the eternal JavaScript debate: semicolons &amp;ndash; yes or no?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer - Yammer (Mobile/Android) Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media has dramatically changed the way we share and connect with friends and family, and it will have an even more profound impact on the way companies operate. Yammer and Microsoft provide a secure, private social network for your company. Yammer empowers employees to be more productive and successful by enabling them to collaborate easily, make smarter decisions faster, and self-organize into teams to take on any business challenge. It is a way of working that naturally drives business alignment and agility, reduces cycle times, engages employees and improves relationships with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know devices are the future; come help us design the future of great work software on Android-powered devices. We&amp;rsquo;re building a product that empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent way of doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yammer team is located in San Francisco, and we maintain the intensity, pragmatism, and velocity of a startup. We release product weekly and projects last weeks, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is structured around designers who are flexible, but who specialize in either visual/UI or interaction/UX. Our UI designers translate wireframes into pixel-perfect, typographically beautiful, development-ready visuals. Your visual designs and ideas are an integral part of what makes a feature stick. You&amp;rsquo;ll be part of feature project teams from the beginning until launch, working side-by-side with a product manager, UX designer, researcher, engineering team, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-3 years’ experience working, preferably at more than one past company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated understanding of Android’s User Interface Guidelines through completed design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise working daily in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide visual specification and production ready files to engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited that their designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic and possibly a little bit weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eager to move to a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UIDesigner at Litmus in Cambridge, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re bootstrapped, profitable and proud. You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with our team of
developers building cool stuff, with amazing people. Here&amp;rsquo;s what some of our 11
person crew have to say about Litmus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone. Gives. A. Shit. (about the tech, the products, the customers, each other). Trust and ownership are important here. We build products that scratch our own itch. We experiment, we celebrate (big things (like throwing a launch party), and small (beers at the end of the week)). Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s no red tape, bullshit posturing, timecards or org charts!&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Eddie, Ruby Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aside from software architecture and syntax, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a task that I have begun that I have known how to do. It is a constant learning experience and we often times find ourselves building things that have never been built before.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justin, C# Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re in charge of our own future and aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden by a board, investors or anyone else. I feel like the people I work for care more for our customers and their employees than most other companies do.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justine, Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Super cool office! &amp;ndash; Our office is amazing and we do a lot of cool things here. Kinect + beer fridays + fun :) It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to get to and a great location.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Danielle, Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &quot;founders&amp;rdquo; are in the thick of it. Also, the collective responsibility, I feel like I could rely on any team member for help.&amp;ldquo;
&lt;strong&gt;James, Account Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About The Position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer everything you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cutting edge, financially successful start
up. Great salary, full health care benefits, 28 days paid vacation (yes, on top of
public holidays!), beautiful office space complete with a Kinect, beer fridge and
Sonos sound system. We also buy you lunch, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the very best money can buy: SSD drives, dual Apple
Displays, Aeron chairs, huge desks, 10&quot; tablets and whatever else you need to be
awesome at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention our office? Seconds from the Central Square T in Cambridge, we have the 11th floor to ourselves. Stunning views, beautiful furniture and top of the line equipment. You have to see it; it&amp;rsquo;s stunning. Design is a key selling point of our products. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone to take over responsibility for all aspects of design and user experience at Litmus. We&amp;rsquo;ll give you all the resources and support you need to craft beautiful, elegant experiences that delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing the user interfaces for all our web-based products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working closely with our development team to oversee the implementation of your designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-ordinating user testing of our product and your own prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping in to help with user experience decisions whenever they arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The ideal candidate has:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio showcasing excellent skills in design and UX principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of layout, typography, color and other design principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Watch our &lt;a href=&quot;http://litmus.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Meet the team&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; video.&lt;br/&gt;

				<title>UI Engineer / FrontEndDeveloper at Hearsay Social in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who knows what makes a website look and behave well and also has the random set of skills to actually
make it happen. Someone who is so OCD that she even wants her code to look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who understands that there are living, breathing people at the other end of the tube. They’re impatient.
They read very little. Sometimes they use ancient devices that you wouldn’t touch with a 10 foot pole, but hey they’re your guests and you’re open-minded so you accommodate them. If they can’t figure something out, it&amp;rsquo;s not their fault; it&amp;rsquo;s your fault for building a confusing application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer you believe less is more. You deconstruct a page to its most crucial elements (after figuring out what the most crucial elements are). You show and don’t tell. You realize that we are building a business application and not (thank God) a consumer daily deal site. As such, our site should be timelessly elegant without being trendy. You are consistently consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you want every page to load in a snap. You know that all those &lt;strong&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/strong&gt; cause the browser to chug-a-lug so you use &lt;strong&gt;CSS3 for the bling and kiss the PNGs goodbye&lt;/strong&gt;. You have a visceral reaction to any text that’s part of an image (excepting, of course, logos) because you know it isn&amp;rsquo;t scalable or translatable. Your markup is clean and semantic. You know the difference between &lt;strong&gt;display block, inline and inline-block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what it’s good for but you also know when not to use it. You prefer the &lt;strong&gt;acronym XHR to the misnomer AJAX because it should really be called AJAJ&lt;/strong&gt;. You like to experiment with new paradigms like Backbone but ultimately know it’s just one of many different implementations; it’s the thing you’re implementing that’s important not the technology that gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You secretly know that front end development is harder than back end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-end Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful
ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing
channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way:
organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more
downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as
app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a
slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of
user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong
opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in
everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your
HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire
employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it&lt;/em&gt;. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part
of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying
customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to
becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well compensated&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation
package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome team&lt;/em&gt;. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include
sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Mobile Developer (Android &amp; iOS) at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Developer &amp;ndash; Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect of mobile and web games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands technology trade-offs for development platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android development experience using cross platform tools. i.e. creating one code base that can be compiled for both Android and iOS on same platform a plus, e.g. use of LiveCode, Marmalade, Corona&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to take initiative to be productive and efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to work independently and within a team, depending on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires hands-on architecting, designing, and coding new features on IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate with team members in design reviews and code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of development experience in IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen Poker Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We currently have demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Android and iOS Mobile Developers at CSC in Cincinnati, OH</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;CSC (www.csc.com), one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative and successful IT services firms, is looking for candidates to help grow our talented consulting team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for individuals who:
* Strive for excellence in everything they do
* Bring a partnering approach to their job
* Focus on the innovative use of technology to overcome business challenges
* Seek to work in a environment that respects individual ideas and diversity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we are seeking to hire Mobility developers with deep skills in Android to work with clients to design and deliver solutions that meet their specific business objectives. You will leverage and grow your knowledge and skills in a fast-paced, rewarding environment &amp;mdash; working side-by-side with our team of world class consultants.  In addition to a rewarding work environment, CSC offers an outstanding set of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a Sr. Android developer with 3 to 5 years of commercial experience in developing software solutions with a focus on user interface design.   Ideal candidate will have developed 10+ apps on a professional basis, either for individual sale or for enterprise customers. Experience in iOS and HTML5 development a big plus.  You will be working with a team of User Experience professionals and Solution Architects to deliver mobile application (BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company:  CSC (www.csc.com) is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading providers of information technology services, helping organizations achieve business results through the effective use of technology. Since its formation in 1959, CSC has earned a customer-centric reputation for developing and managing solutions specifically tailored to each client&amp;rsquo;s needs. No other company offers the same range of professional services and global reach as CSC does in areas such as business and technology strategies, management consulting, information systems consulting and integration, application software, and IT and business process outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSC is a leading provider of management and information technology services to commercial and government markets in over 90 countries.  Our consulting portfolio spans the full life cycle &amp;ndash; from strategy and business process design to technology services, systems integration, application outsourcing and hosting.  Our clients benefit from the breadth and depth of our global expertise, but more importantly, CSC goes to market using a team of local experts, creating a relaxed, professional-casual atmosphere, while maintaining a family and people-oriented culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we right for you?  CSC offers a variety of challenging opportunities that will draw on your talents while enabling you to grow your intellectual capital in a supportive environment.  Learning experiences are offered as a blend of relevant work assignments, training, tools, mentoring and other growth opportunities.  We offer many avenues to mastering your chosen profession, while giving you everyday exposure to brilliance in business, technology and people.  As one employee puts it &amp;ldquo;you have the freedom to explore different technologies, the mobility to move from one role to another (or one country to another), and the possibilities of learning from 92,000 colleagues worldwide &amp;ndash; without changing employer or losing benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career Advancement:  Your career belongs to you. At CSC, we recognize that you are in control of identifying and achieving your career goals.  CSC enables you to take the lead through our formal development planning process.  We will help you create a plan for enhancing your skills and experience by providing information, tools, and people that will support your career planning efforts.  We have identified over 60 standard roles that exist across CSC Consulting, as well as the corresponding skills needed to succeed in those roles.  You can use this information to identify your next assignment or an entire career path anywhere in the U.S. or potentially the world.  A career at CSC can be as targeted or eclectic as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectation for Travel:  For the Global Business Solutions division of CSC, all roles require a commitment to 100% travel.  This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a person will always be traveling for assignments, but new Consultants joining the CSC team need to understand that they could be assigned to a travel role.  The staffing process focuses on assigning people to local roles as a first priority, however, if a Consultant is available and has the right skills for an assignment for another CSC office across the United States, the Consultant may be staffed into that travel assignment.  When this happens, they travel to the project location at the start of the week, return at the end of the work week and are home during the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior Applications Developer at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Sr. Applications Developer &amp;amp; Systems Specialist * Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect or advanced developer  of mobile or web games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands technology trade-offs for development platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience building native web and mobile apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced developing  with rich media and interactive web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with the majority of: JavaScript, HTML(5), CSS3, JSON, Jquery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced in object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recently demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a windows shop. However, ff you have an open source background and consider youself the agnostic type with a high stadard for making quality, scalable software, then we&amp;rsquo;d love to connect with and tell you more details surrounding the greatest technology challenge of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Funding &amp;amp; The Legalization of Online Poker in California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is underway and funded by a well-known and big Native American casino. This is an important point because the proposed law states that in order to run an online poker system you must already hold a gaming license in CA. The tribe will also provide the $35-40M required to obtain the license when the licensing process is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legalization of online poker in California is anticipated to be enacted in 2013 with the ability to open the online poker room either in late 2013 or early 2014. The bill for legalization is known as CA Senate Bill 51 which was introduced by Senator Roderick Wright on Dec 21, 2012. It was first introduced by on 2/24/12 as SB 1463 before being withdrawn several months later.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Developer at StudentsFirst in Sacramento, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a national grassroots movement of more than 2 million parents, teachers, students, administrators and concerned citizens mobilizing for one purpose: to put the laws and leaders in place to make students the focus of and ensure America has the best schools in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things the old way for too long.  Pitting the interests of the grown-ups in the system against one another, for example, rather than focusing on real solutions.  No one won. And students lost.  In too many American schools, current laws, policies, and practices are putting adult interests ahead of students. The result is an increasingly broken education system that, if not corrected, will keep America from leading in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new approach that puts students' interests at the center of education policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are channeling the energy of our members to produce meaningful results on both the local and national level. We are working with bipartisan state legislators to create laws and policies that put the needs of students above any other interest in the system. Our members are pushing for reforms that will elevate the teaching profession and improve teacher and principal quality, empower parents and improve the governance and financial strength of school districts. Together, we’ve already helped pass more than 50 new policies in half a dozen states. We have helped improve education systems affecting millions of students. We’re transforming public education to ensure great teachers and great schools for all of our kids. StudentsFirst was founded in 2010 by former Washington D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee.&lt;/p&gt;
