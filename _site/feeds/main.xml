&lt;p&gt;This role requires a mix of user interface and visual design skills. You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you believe usability &amp;amp; delight goes beyond (but still works closely with) visual aesthetics, this may very well be the perfect role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online portfolio is required to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Flexibility in learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work within, manage and extend design styleguides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert in web design tools (ie: Fireworks, Photoshop, llustrator, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Axure, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with usability testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches &amp;amp; wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess a self-motivated, &amp;ldquo;git &amp;lsquo;er done&amp;rdquo; work ethic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 years minimum experience designing interfaces that incorporate &amp;amp; extend a brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire &amp;amp; effort to grow and remain relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company culture &amp;ndash; like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days &amp;ndash; appeals and is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you&amp;rsquo;re curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Senior UI Designer at Salesforce in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com transformed the enterprise software market with cloud computing. We’ve launched business apps and platforms that are as easy to use as Amazon.com and as social as Facebook. Recognized as the world’s most innovative company and the third fastest-growing technology company by Forbes and for the third consecutive year in 2011 selected as one of the &amp;ldquo;Best Places to Work&amp;rdquo; by FORTUNE magazine, we now have our sights set on the next generation of cloud computing. Our technology teams are the brains behind visionary technologies like the Force.com platform, and enterprise social collaboration tools like Salesforce Chatter and the AppExchange marketplace. With more than 7,000 employees, the first enterprise cloud computing company to exceed $2.0B in annual revenue run rate, and more than 100,000 customers worldwide, we are proud to contribute to the success of companies of all sizes and industries, around the globe. If you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about innovation, come help revolutionize how companies collaborate and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk.com is a fast-paced startup inside Salesforce.com, which means you get the best of both worlds: small teams, fun projects, and fast execution backed by the vast resources of a publicly traded company. We have the cool vibe of a startup and the dependability of an established player. We are headquartered in San Francisco and have really cool offices south of Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a highly-motivated Sr. UI Designer with a strong understanding of design, to contribute in shaping the user interface of our product and strengthening our online presence across web, tablet, and mobile devices. We drive our product by the user experience, and need someone with the skills who can keep up and push the vision forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will work directly with other members of the product team to build experiences that reinforce the Desk.com brand and help wow our customers. You will get to work in an exciting and engaging agile startup-like environment where you will be encouraged to expand your skills, test your creative boundaries, share new ideas, and most importantly – have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, iterate, and refine UI and UX concepts for the company’s core products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with product managers, front-end engineers, and other UI designers to insure we maintain a high-quality user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with your team to meet the demands of our customers, while at the same time continuing to innovate far beyond the competition. .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required/Desired Skills:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a master of your craft and tools. As a designer you are expected to have a dominating control over Photoshop, as well as create satisfying interfaces boasting user-centered design principles for our core applications. Bonus for a dribbble or other online portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get excited to work with some of the coolest clients on the web on a product that people love using. With customers like 37signals, Rdio, Square, Pandora, many more, we’re building software that real companies are using and we need you to contribute to our evolution. You must be excited about your role! Anybody can build something that’s “good”, but true passion breeds “incredible.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like to deliver real results. So, you’ve got some design and prototyping chops but do you have the ability to bring your work to life? This is a great opportunity to expand your front-end skills, and learn from an exceptionally talented team. You’ll need to be able to build those great experiences with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bonus if terms like HAML, CoffeeScript, and AngularJS not only make sense to you, but excite you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On occasion, you will have to receive feedback from our customers &amp;ndash; so excellent written and oral communication skills are a must!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;You love to build products. You love to hack on web code. You love large scaling challenges, neat and complex algorithms, and working with a talented passionate team making a dent in the universe. You should work at Smarterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to measure the world’s skills. We’re tapping into the fundamental need for people to be able to measure what they know, engaging the increasing number of digital tools that are part of everyone’s lives, and building a reliable way to prove skills to others (peers, employers, and the world). We’re small but growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In joining our team, you’ll have a strong voice in our technology and product. We also believe that hacking is akin to painting so we’re not shy about making sure you’ll have the exact right tools for you to get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who we’re looking for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal fit for us would be someone with a strong passion for programming, interest in the whole web technology stack, interest in the philosophy and details of actually making web products work (deployment, testing, as well as dev management and principles). The ideal candidate wants to “own” big pieces of the vision and functionality. We’re very interested in (but not limited to) people who identify themselves as “full stack” developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a coding position, you’ll be a core member of the technology team, deeply involved in both the design and implementation of our technology. Our stack is mostly Javascript and Python using a lightweight, open source, semi-custom framework but our search is not limited to “python people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culturally, we’re low-ego and friendly, but super passionate about what we do. We’re looking for someone who is as passionate as we are and who strongly fits with the existing team. As a member of the core team, you’ll not only help us shape our technology and product, but will also help form the culture of our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you’re good with (or very interested in) these technologies
JavaScript, Python, Ruby, MySQL, AWS (or other cloud providers), Django, SQLAlchemy, Pylons, WSGI, NoSQL, memcached, REST design principles, API design and integration, async/concurrent IO programming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boston:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re based right in the middle of the Boston/Cambridge tech scene with hundreds of startups, over 500 regular tech and programming meet-ups and events, and tens of thousands of smart, motivated people building cool, innovative products. Boston is a great place to live and work, with a rich startup and technology ecosystem. If you’re not already in Boston, reach out and we’ll tell you more about why this is the perfect place for a developer to build their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smarterer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smarterer scores digital, social, and technical skills using crowdsourced test design and an adaptive scoring algorithm. In the past year, Smarterer users have taken more than 1.9 million tests and answered almost 20 million questions.  Our vision: Become the global standard in skills measurement. The opportunity? Huge!  Smarterer is backed by Google Ventures and True Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Company Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion-io is the pioneer of a new storage memory platform that significantly improves the processing capabilities within a data center by moving process-critical, or active data closer to the CPU where it is processed. Called shared data decentralization, this significantly reduces latency while increasing data center efficiency. Fusion’s integrated hardware and software solutions leverage non-volatile memory for enterprise-grade performance, reliability, availability and manageability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2006 by a management team with experience in transaction processing, high-performance networking, storage, superclusters, and computing and image processing, Fusion-io recognized that mechanical storage architectures do not keep pace with advances in digital processing power. This meant that despite major advances in technology, data processing was limited to the speed of legacy storage infrastructures. Without a solution designed to maximize their capabilities, modern CPUs sit idle while they wait for data to process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion-io solves the data supply problem with a new purpose-built solution. By combining hardware and software to develop a reliable storage memory platform, Fusion-io gives servers native access to data to accelerate enterprise databases and applications. This allows enterprises to significantly reduce complex and expensive high performance storage, high performance networking, and memory-rich servers.In addition to accelerating performance, Fusion’s storage memory platform also reduces energy consumption and total cost of ownership&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails Developer at ZOLL in Broomfield, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between this job and being a super hero? Both involve saving lives, but we actually pay you.
We are the leader for management and training of life saving devices such as defibrillators. We have the resources and stability of a large company, but the nimbleness, ambition, and determination of a startup, because we used to be one.
We have a small, highly motivated team and the most important thing is to be a demonstrated self-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we have to offer you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention super hero? Our office is casual enough you could wear a super hero costume, although shorts and flip flops may be more appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectually engaging discussions about software architecture among self-proclaimed experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciation that the work you do makes us a better company (mostly in the form of a competitive salary and benefits, but could also include cookies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mean what we say &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies for three consecutive years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability &amp;ndash; We&amp;rsquo;re on Fortune&amp;rsquo;s list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What we are looking for from you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super hero like ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails coding skills that would make DHH proud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly insatiable appetite to solve difficult problems fast, which may mean the fewest CPU cycles or developer cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok, and maybe some technical prowess with Git/Github, TDD, Postgres, OSX, Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design/front-end skills are a big plus &amp;ndash; particularly standards-based clean, maintainable markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of humor, because really, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t this all be fun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Love what you do? So do we, which is why 9mmedia has been building amazing things for over 10 years now. We mostly work with startups, and our culture mostly resembles a startup &amp;ndash; well, only the good parts, that is. We are a group of 20ish passionate, smart, nice, fun people who all love working together in our gorgeous NYC office. We’ve worked hard to create an inspiring space and culture that combines the best of both worlds &amp;ndash; the interesting technological challenges and excitement of a startup, and the stability and comfort of a lifestyle business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our clients are our partners, so if you like being an integral part of developing and starting businesses, you’ll love how we operate. We have a small handful of projects going at any given time, and you’ll get the opportunity to work on many projects over the years, each with its own unique challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all that sounds good, we’d love to hear from you! We believe in giving all developers a lot of responsibility and control over what they do, and in treating people with trust and respect. We have no middle management, and you can make your own hours &amp;ndash; and no, that isn’t code for us expecting you to be in the office 24/7. We only care about people who can work hard, produce great apps, and get things done. You’ll get to learn lots of new technology, enhance your skills, and have a ton of influence over every product you touch here. We are looking for the sort of person who will speak up to help improve not only our products, but also our process, our technology and our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a great iOS developer you already know what we’re looking for, but one must observe the forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid command of the iOS SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cocoa / Objective-C proficiency&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Senior User Experience Designer at Netflix in Los Gatos, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, designer!
Acquisition requires a unique skill that you have. You know how to inform and entice all while keeping it simple. You understand how to create a campaign across the globe. You know and understand how to draw people in with just the right amount of context. Do you have ideas how to communicate Netflix’s offer to the world? We want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re truly talented—recognized among your peers as the best. Your portfolio inspires and impresses other designers. Frankly, it also makes them a little jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an innovator by nature.  You “think” AND “do”. You’re smart, confident, highly competent—and mature enough not to have an ego. You’re a skilled communicator who welcomes honest, candid feedback. You believe that the best designs prove themselves in the marketplace, and you think of data and testing as allies in creating the best possible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have exceptional visual skills, and impeccable sensibility for color, composition, form and story. You’re a genius at solving interactive problems—and you’re passionate about exploring new frontiers in web, TV and mobile interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is an especially exciting time to join our design team. We’re growing rapidly and we have multiple openings. If you’re ready to add your vision—to imagine an alternate future—this is a rare opportunity. The things you discover and create will have widespread impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a place where talented, curious people come together to share ideas and solutions. Although Netflix is an established company, in many ways we still act like a start up, allowing us to act quickly on emerging business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we find the right people, we value them deeply—our compensation, benefits, and culture are hard to beat. We also believe creativity comes from happy, fearless and energetic individuals—so we’re serious about a healthy life-work balance and a comfortable, casual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Must Haves:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5+ years design on consumer-friendly interactive experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great portfolio that showcases deep visual and interaction design skills?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to rapidly produce multiple UX/UI concepts ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication skills to clearly articulate your concepts—and evangelize on their behalf?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across the entire product lifecycle and have lived through multiple launches (experience with international launches is a plus)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BA/BS in fine arts, graphic arts, human factors or related field ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good sense of humor ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A love of movies and TV shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at MarkIT X in Chicago, IL</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;MarkITX is looking for a front-end developer to join our team. We want colleagues who are smart and get things done, who are inveterate builders, tinkerers and detectives. We hire people not experience levels, so we have a place for you whether you have built your own MVC framework or are fresh out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $20MM in orders and over $150k per week in transactions, roughly doubling every month. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best consumer web apps have far surpassed the best enterprise apps in terms of user experience. Our enterprise users are accustomed to absolutely horrible user experiences with existing options. This gives us a massive opportunity to wow our users with the kind of consumer-grade experience they’re getting used to out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We Expect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re more excited about what you can learn, than by what you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can take a project from problem, through ideas and user testing to implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with a startup, and all that entails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a set of tools that you know intimately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re happy to give and receive thoughtful criticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will quickly get comfortable with our Node.js, Backbone, Handlebars, LESS, Brunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve used a VCS, and can quickly get comfortable with Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll commit to production on your first day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can move with the right team around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;We Provide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team of world-class sales, marketing, engineering, design, data and operations experts who are excited to teach you, and to learn from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A top-level commitment to open source. We publish and contribute, and you will too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An amazing work environment at 1871, the heart of Chicago’s digital startup ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A competitive compensation package, including equity participation and health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please email us at js@markitx.com.&lt;/p&gt;

The ideal candidate will be a well-rounded UX generalist who combines outstanding design skills with strong analytical, technical, and problem-solving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Job Functions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with product managers to understand complex functional requirements and transform them into detailed design specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate design recommendations using wireframes, flowcharts, high-fidelity design comps, interactive prototypes, and the occasional cocktail napkin&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Advocate for the needs of end-users throughout the product design process; evangelize &amp;amp; promote good design principles and best practices throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independently manage multiple, concurrent projects in a fast-paced development environment, proactively ensuring that appropriate UX considerations are made throughout the SDLC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with project stakeholders to build consensus behind the best practical (not always the best possible) design solutions; produce final design specs that balance development deadlines and implementation costs against key design considerations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Organize and facilitate small-scale usability tests&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite; working knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough understanding of fundamental design principles and usability heuristics; ability to articulate the reasoning behind design decisions and communicate effectively with non-designers&lt;/li&gt;

We currently use WPF/XAML for the bulk of our prototyping work. At a minimum, the successful candidate will be tech-savvy, curious, and motivated to learn new skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to create polished, professional designs that anticipate and accommodate the needs of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume, and a portfolio of recent design work.&lt;/li&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an experienced visual interface designer to join our design practice at Vertigo. Our company, with offices in California and Oregon, designs and builds world-class interactive products for brand name clients across a broad range of industries. Every team member has the opportunity to work with a variety of platforms (Web, iOS, Windows 8, Xbox, Android) and clients, each one presenting a unique creative challenge. At Vertigo we work in a multi-disciplinary approach. Our engineering practice understands the exceptional value that good design brings to the products we build – you will see your design ideas implemented in the final product pretty much as you intended. And we ship or launch 99.9% of what we start. That’s pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What We’re Looking For&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost you are passionate about solving real-world visual design challenges. But of course you have a solid knowledge of visual design skills, processes and deliverables and know how to apply them to interactive products. You love color, typography, and a good sketch, and you’re willing to push creative boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a creative visual thinker who can successfully plan and prioritize your work, but you’re at your best in collaborative team environments. You have strong communication skills and can clearly articulate your design concepts to internal teams and clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how to shepherd your designs through the project lifecycle from hand sketch to final artwork. You pay close attention to detail and you’re willing to iterate, refine and polish the design to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you love working with smart, talented, fun people in a creative atmosphere of collaboration doing the best work possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of typography, color, layout, data visualization, and brand systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for application-specific contexts – UI controls, iconography, device resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of common visual design tools – pencils to pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for iOS, Android, modern web standards and Microsoft platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to facilitate or participate in design ideation sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work productively with engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the needs of a consulting business: time, scope and budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to  Scrum or Agile development methodologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client consulting experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing desire to learn and to share what you know with your colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction design or web development skills are a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with motion graphics or animation a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please include a link to an online portfolio in your resume.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at Zaarly in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Zaarly is changing how the economy works. That&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;hellip; just a little global economic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zaarly enables people to ask for anything from people nearby. A simple idea; but when it takes root in a community, the impact is profound. Buyers decide what they want and the price they want to pay and someone from the community makes it happen, creating a job and keeping money local. Zaarly helps anyone invest directly into their local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we’re a tech company, but what we&amp;rsquo;re building helps people change their community.  These are big ideas requiring enormous talent, borderline fanaticism and maybe a small dose of insanity. We&amp;rsquo;ve got an amazing team with the right mix.  Let&amp;rsquo;s do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a geek at heart, and you dream in mobile. You download apps from the App Store to dissect them and figure out how they were built. You ache to be part of a startup where your work is front and center. You&amp;rsquo;re tired of working on boring projects that you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in. You&amp;rsquo;re ready to work with a team that is doing something big, something worthwhile, something ridiculously cool. Right on! You&amp;rsquo;re hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architect, build and maintain the Zaarly iPhone app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new, exciting features and push code to hundreds of thousands of iPhone Zaarly users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up-to-date on the latest iPhone SDK developments, respond to customer feedback &amp;amp; testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience developing native iPhone apps or other mobile apps is strongly preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong Objective-C skills (Ruby and C/C++/ are a plus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An eye for great design and user experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passionate about quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate within a close-knit team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard-working and a fast learner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have one or more iPhone apps published in the App Store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Nice-to-Have’s:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Strong framework outside of iOS is always a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;About Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ÜberConference is working on the future of communications and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for great people to join us. We&amp;rsquo;re a small team, obsessed with elegant design and efficient solutions to big problems. Our office is fast-paced, loud and crazy. We like making things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perks:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% paid Medical, Dental and Vision Plan for you and your dependents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday Weekly Socials and a Company Game Room complete with a game consoles, a ping pong and a beer pong table.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Radically accelerate the sales cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No similar product exists that intuitively provides a cohesive, streamlined solution.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager at StyledOn in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;StyledOn.com is a VC-backed startup based in NY and LA focused on creating the largest style centric social network — we are well on our way, but we need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a marriage of fashion and technology. If this sounds appealing to you, check our current openings and see if your skill set matches. However, if you don’t see something that matches your skills or tickles your fancy, and you think you are good enough for us to create a job for you, we invite you to send us your resume with an email on why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all busy here at StyledOn, so don’t send us fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more creative, the more thoughtful, the better your chances! Email positions@styledon.com with your proposed title in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How we define Product Management:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Management brings our ideas to fruition. This takes a supernatural ability to be both technical and creative, and, most importantly, to project manage to successful launch. StyledOn is creating a social network that is laser focused on “style”, and we are looking for individuals who are masters at creating, managing, and nurturing both online social mediums and mobile products. Product management is our guiding light as to what our market wants/craves/needs and helps our marketing department in positioning, packaging, and promoting the products that are created—after all, no one is more passionate than the creator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The role: Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StyledOn is looking for a Product Jedi Master. We are in the troughs of re-launching our online properties and creating our mobile applications and we need a hard-nosed, battle-tested technologist who knows how to bring to market a hatched idea. He/she needs to be ambitious and self-managed with a proven track record of defining, creating and managing market leading interactive products in a consumer-facing environment. We employ both internal shared resources and outsourced development houses to accomplish our product goals, so we are looking for someone who also has experience managing a diverse development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities boiled down:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a deep understanding of the competitive landscape in our vertical through analysis, user research and site testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead usability tests, feasibility studies, review web analytics and conduct user research to deliver high-quality products that meet user needs, or, better yet, create new user “needs”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own and manage every aspect of the product lifecycle and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly define requirements at a functional and technical level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope project strategies, initiatives, budgets and resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop project plan and resource allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain overall product and feature roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and present hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and feature concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, monitor and report progress against key success metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate product strategies and objectives into specific tactical plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, most importantly, EXECUTE on plan and hit timelines and targets!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BA/BS in Computer Science or a related technical field preferred (MS or Ph.D is a plus).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of 5-8 years of product design and management experience in web-based businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in working on online content businesses, and in particular, experience in building online communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in product design and management of mobile products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product management record (e.g. writing MRDs and PRDs, performing competitive analysis, creating product roadmaps, creating presentations that communicate product features &amp;amp; benefits, defining user interfaces, creating wireframes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical thinker with exceptional verbal and written skills; this individual is the communication hub of product-related matters and must be able to communicate effectively with different roles in the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong business acumen and grasp of business fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical, organizational, and problem solving skills with ability to interpret data into key learnings and product strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter and team player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of comfort with working closely with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High integrity and a record of excellence in your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A true passion for product design and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the “social sphere” space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and oral communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent organizational and analytical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong technical abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in project managing outsourced development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;How to apply:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive hundreds of resumes and we can’t read them all. If you are interested in this position, and consider your skill set a good fit, do more than just send us your resume. If you are serious about being considered and want us to spend our time in reviewing your qualifications, then you should spend your time in presenting to us why you are a good fit. Include in your email something, anything that separates you from the crowd. Get creative! Get inventive! Give us your ideas of a product roadmap. Tell us where we are falling short. Give us your idea on a mobile app. We dare you to come up with something that makes us salivate so we can’t wait to hire you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email positions@styledon.com with “Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager” in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior Operations Developer at Aweber Communications in Chalfont, PA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Role:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senior Operations Developer role focuses on pushing forward efforts in system automation and deployment using tools like Chef and Puppet, building REST APIs using Python frameworks like Flask and Tornado, and researching new solutions to help drive platform innovation in any part of the organization. The role also participates in many other initiatives, not the least of which is solidifying and furthering our commitment to collaboration and cooperation between development and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A sampling of the types of projects performed by this role might include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building out event-oriented message queuing architectures to increase efficiency and open data streams to multiple applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and/or build new solutions to provide new services and functionality to the internal application platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate and expand the collection and use of metrics, leveraging new &amp;amp; existing tools to provide visualizations to both business and technical parts of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;You:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an experienced engineer. You’ve worked on multiple projects in various environments. You’ve put things into production, you’ve had people use them, you’ve failed, you’ve succeeded, you’ve paid your dues, and learned your lessons. You have a passion for technology, and view what you do as a craft. You like your job, but love your work. It’s something you’d do (and have done) even if there were no money or job involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You enjoy working with open source languages, toolchains, systems, and databases, and are always seeking out new solutions to difficult problems. Where those solutions are found lacking, you contribute, and occasionally build your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cringe at the thought of having to make a definitive choice between doing only software engineering or only systems engineering. You like to have your hands in all of it, and to be able to understand and affect change to any part of your work, front end to back end. You strongly resist pigeonholing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thrive in environments where technological and innovative velocity is high, and the overhead from administrivia is low. You can work well in isolation, but are happy to collaborate in a team setting, and might not even mind doing the occasional pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWeber’s engineering team is a dynamic and exciting place to be. We use open source technologies like PostgreSQL, Python, MongoDB, Redis, Riak, Chef, Ruby, Graphite, and RabbitMQ. We use approaches to software quality like Test-Driven Development, Continuous Deployment, and a healthy addiction to metrics that give us insight into our applications, and how well they’re serving our customers. We have a mode of execution built around Kanban, and a Kaizen culture of continuous improvement. We believe in the kind of transparency, processes, data sharing, collaboration, and communication that foster a DevOps culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid PPO medical, dental, vision, insurance. (including domestic partner benefits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Short Term Disability Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Paid Life Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuition reimbursement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully Reimbursed Gym Memberships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 weeks paid time off  (plus increases in paid time off)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid holidays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;401K retirement benefits with company match and profit sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free lunches everyday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break rooms stocked with soda, juices, coffee and teas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro laptops and 30&quot; monitors for all development team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple high definition theater rooms fully equipped with xbox, wii &amp;amp; blu-ray players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work must be beautiful, usable, and tell a story. We love digging into complex and messy problems because that&amp;rsquo;s our opportunity to tease a little order out of the chaos. We work with other designers, developers, financial analysts, and our clients to set new standards for information design. This work is widely used, billions of views each day (that’s billion, with a ‘b’), so what you do here matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exciting, right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a team of over 30 designers, and as business continues to grow, so do we. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for people who can create compelling experiences, who live and die by the grid, and who can see a story in a thousand data points. The skills we employ include everything from user research, information architecture and wireframes to pixel-perfect interactive comps. We hope Adobe Creative Suite is an extension of your hands, you know enough CSS to be dangerous and maybe even play around in Processing from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Still interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This might be your kind of place if you&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think design lies in the intentionally imperfect union of form and function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can tell us a story through numbers alone. Or chopsticks for that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovered Tufte and realized you weren&amp;rsquo;t alone in your obsession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Oh, and us? How nice of you to ask. We&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t love cubicles. Or barriers of any kind really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blush when clients call us data geeks, or tell us we&amp;rsquo;re detail obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are equally fascinated by Radiolab and Planet Money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;On top of the good stuff like competitive salaries, health insurance, and 401k, there's…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting paid to bike, bus or carpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlimited chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time to work on what you want (like that crazy idea you have been dreaming about for months).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;So if you think you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit here, send us…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your résumé. We need to see how well you color inside the lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your portfolio, Dribbble link or any other work examples. Coloring outside the lines is encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a link to your favorite data visualization and what about it resonates with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What We Offer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Help develop, manage, and refine UI pattern libraries and interaction guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate with developers through implementation phase to realize design vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate, defend, and build consensus around experience architecture and interaction design direction&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who deeply understands the bleeding edge of the Apple frameworks from the bare metal on up to the higher level APIs? Are you outrageously detail oriented? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible with iOS since late 2008 with mobile computer vision apps like RedLaser (acquired by eBay in 2010) and 360 Panorama. We&amp;rsquo;re not just an &amp;ldquo;app company.&amp;rdquo; We strive to change the world through our products and their underlying state-of-the-art computer vision technology, all of which is built from scratch by our broadly-talented team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need someone who knows exactly what the Apple iOS SDK is doing under the covers and can help us build innovative computer vision applications the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the text of an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough knowledge of memory management on iOS is ingrained in you. You can optimize the memory footprint of an app, avoid memory leaks like the plague, and you know what NSZombieEnabled is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can recite the exact setup / teardown process that UIKit follows for UIViewController and UIViews in your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve worked with AV Foundation, know what YCbCr is, and perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve even written a camera-based application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built a game or other graphics-based app using Open GL ES 2.0 and think pixel shaders are the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built an app that is live on the App Store that we can try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well compensated. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-End Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When you see a terrible UI do you have a hundred ideas on how you could do it better? Does creating next-gen user experiences get you out of bed in the morning? Are you so detailed oriented that an unwanted single pixel offset bugs you? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Occipital, we love creating amazing user-experiences on the web that work for all common browsers, but we also love pushing the envelope with the latest tech. With 360 Panorama, for example, we created an interactive viewer that works across almost every browser, but we also added gyro support for the mobile safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve just started scratching the surface of what’s possible with the font-end web, and we will do a lot more. The experiences we create around our computer vision powered products are brand new and require next-gen interfaces &amp;ndash; we want someone who can help us bring these experiences to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the size of a text field, even if that reason is that it looks better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience above all else &amp;ndash; You’ll deal with things like browser compatibility issues in an elegant way to make sure users on all popular browsers have a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an active Github account and can show us some code you are proud of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can tap into a user’s sensorimotor cortex to create Natural User Interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable Javascript and know when to use libraries like jQuery and when to just write something custom for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve built something with WebGL and have tons of ideas on how to take advantage of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to push the asynchronous envelope with Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with Python/Django.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve built something using maps or geo data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe 3D is a big part of the future, and you like to subtly integrate it into normal 2D web experiences, but then go all out when you’ve got HTML5 and WebGL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience building something non-trivial using Flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to join the team that’s building the future of Augmented Reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Director Customer Support at Hulu in Los Angeles, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Hulu Support team is dedicated to providing customer support so awesome that it will make users’ heads spin. Seriously. Our goal is to be the absolute best in the world at what we do, and this is a challenge we do not take lightly. We send emails in prose, tweet troubleshooting steps in less than 140 characters, and answer calls so fast users haven’t realized the phone was ringing. We call this “the support we wish we got everywhere else”, and as we go about providing it, we’re looking for a Director of Customer Support to help us take our goals to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a creative and exciting technology company that is on a strong growth trajectory &amp;mdash; we&amp;rsquo;ve been ahead of expectations in all measures of success since our founding in 2007. We pride ourselves on adding people to the team who can perform at a high level while exercising impeccable judgment. You know the type – they are intellectually curious, relentless in their pursuit of better ways, and possess an atypically high attention to detail. We trust them to do the right thing, give them the resources necessary to do so, and try to have some fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Director of Customer Support, you will be reporting to the VP of Product Development. While you will assume leadership of current day-to-day activities, your mission will be to establish Hulu as the customer support organization others want to replicate. This challenge will involve managing the continued growth of the organization, refining the customer support strategy, scaling to additional locations in the US, and building the tools and processes needed to implement that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other core responsibilities will include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exemplifying the Hulu culture on a daily basis, and fostering it in your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining and driving the ongoing development of Hulu&amp;rsquo;s customer support strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing on continual improvement of self-help and live-support tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping each team member grow and develop, while merging individual players into a motivated and passionate team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing the CSA leadership team, and mentoring in core management skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying and communicating key feedback trends to Product and Development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring and training the right people to grow a high performing customer support team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing quality of service metrics that ensure a premium-quality customer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Leading from the front&amp;rsquo; by pitching in and responding to customer contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remaining flexible in your schedule, as we intend to provide 24/7 support in the next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just anyone gets to be part of Hulu. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a proven leader who has developed and motivated people, and shaped strong performing teams. While experience working in media and/or technology companies is helpful, we think it&amp;rsquo;s also valuable to have had exposure to multiple industries. Of course it will help to have experience building and scaling CS teams, but just as important, you must demonstrate rabid passion for customers and an understanding that customer support is really both a form of direct marketing and a valuable source of product feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in managing, mentoring and motivating high-performing teams in a constructive manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence, high energy, and a proven ability to drive results under pressure and in the face of ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analytical mindset and a relentless drive to find innovative ways to improve processes and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid understanding of web technology and support challenges in the tech industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of call center operations and best practices, but also the ability to develop a team that can resolve issues without relying on scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with multiple support channels, including an understanding of the scalability and cost effectiveness of web channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing multiple support locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A background in marketing and turning customers into brand ambassadors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUESTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think you’ve got what it takes? Well, Pop Quiz Hotshot, please take a minute to answer the next two questions, and send them in along with your resume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Question 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are brief descriptions of two scenarios someone might have as a customer out in “the real world”. Please choose one of them, put yourself in the shoes of that person, and write a review about what the experience was like (something like a Yelp review). There’s no right or wrong scenario to choose, so don’t spend too much time psychoanalyzing your choice. All we ask is that you keep your response shorter than 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scenario A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting a new doctor’s office for the first time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The receptionist at the front desk was snooty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You arrived on time, but had to wait 47 minutes until the doctor saw you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doctor was super friendly, and had amazing bedside manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only available parking garage cost $15 per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were promised test results by the next day, but never received them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Scenario B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking out the brand new restaurant on the block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You walked in at 7PM on a Friday night, and were quoted a 45 minute wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The host was super friendly and apologetic for the long delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 5 minutes, the manager found you outside to let you know a table had opened up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During your meal, the server delivered the wrong drink order (twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the check came, you noticed the drinks had been taken off the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now picture this. You’re managing a team of CSAs, but decide to jump in the queue to stay current on customer contacts. Please write what you would consider to be the ideal response to the following customer&amp;rsquo;s questions. Basically, rock their world like you’d expect your team to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Hulu,
I recently became a Hulu Plus subscriber but I have two quick questions. First, even though I&amp;rsquo;m paying, why am I still seeing commercials that stutter? Secondly, will I be able to watch all the episodes of The Big Bang Theory and The Office on my TV and iPhone at the same time with Hulu Plus?
Thanks for your help!
Bucky&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to push the boundaries of what’s possible in web technology to help build the future of augmented reality? Are you able to hold a complete understanding of a complex backend system in your head to build fast and reliable web applications and APIs? Do you have a deep understanding of how networking, databases, and servers work down to the bare metal? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re creating a computer vision platform to power the next generation of augmented reality. This is an incredibly complex endeavor that will require everything from sophisticated computer vision algorithms running on mobile devices, to vast storage of visual information, to taking advantage of GPU servers for fast parallel image processing. An important part of this platform will be the web backend system required to tie it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our currently launched product, 360 Panorama, has millions of users and huge potential that we have yet to tap. 360 Panorama users are helping us build the 360VERSE &amp;ndash; a way to explore the world through 360 views, searchable by location AND time (currently in beta, launching soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a web wizard who is excited to help us expand on 360 Panorama and 360VERSE and also help us build the computer vision platform that will usher in a new wave of augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If you have experience with most of the following, we’d love to talk to you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python or other server side scripting language experience (most of our backend is written in Python)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC frameworks (we use Django)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js (used on our GPU servers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres or other SQL experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geospatial / location search using PostGIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*nix server administration and automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of cloud services, including storage and server provisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of front-end technologies (e.g. Javascript, HTML5, WebGL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and ability to debug the full web stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of networking protocols and ability to implement and design new ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Web Developer/Front-End Engineer at AppFolio in Goleta, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to build software that matters? Do you want to work with a brilliant engineering team that really cares that users love their software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppFolio is a fast growing and funded startup in Santa Barbara, CA that is focused on building exciting web-based business applications that customers rave about. We take pride in finding new ways to delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will join our engineering team to design and build user interfaces that are used millions of times each month and help to make people&amp;rsquo;s lives a little bit better. Although all our engineers work across the entire development stack, we are looking to hire specialists specifically in the front-end who can provide expert level guidance to our team and stay on top of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We are looking for people with expert-level proficiency in:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (and libraries like jQuery, Modernizr, Backbone, Underscore, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-browser support and progressive enhancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Inspector/Firebug including the JavaScript debugger and web console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Expert-level proficiency means:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You follow industry leaders and the latest w3 specs to stay on the cutting edge of new technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve downloaded and installed nightly builds of Chrome, Webkit, and Firefox just to try out new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t just use JavaScript libraries, you know how they work. You’ve probably submitted patches to popular libraries or even built your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML semantics is important to you; you’d never have a hard time deciding between using a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;ul&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a solid understanding of CSS selector specificity and you don’t resort to just adding another ID to make one rule trump another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;If you have one or more of the skills below, even better:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Ruby on Rails or similar MVC application framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with SASS, Compass, CoffeeScript or other language preprocessors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Pair programming and green tests make the day fly by with the gratification of clean code without broken windows.

				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Scope of Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG is seeking a Sr. PHP Developer to augment our progressive team of engineers. The position is for long term contract (6+ months) with intent to move to a permanent position within our company. The project we are hiring for could quite possibly be one of the coolest projects you have ever worked on. It combines front-end development with hardware integration within the entertainment industry. EMG will be using a true agile sprint planning process. This position is one among a project team of 4+ developers for this particular project. There will also be a mid-level PHP developer that you will work side-by-side with. No matter what level of engineer you are hired as, there is an expectation that you will teach and learn from your peers and teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG offers a wide array of technical projects to work on in various languages and platforms, each with a different challenge. Our environment is set up so that our developers can touch a little bit of everything for their own experience, and that also enables EMG to deliver high quality products for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All employees of EMG must be positive with a “can do” attitude. The ability to understand risks and time/scope implications and be able to communicate those to your Director of Technology is required. There is not one person at EMG that does not have an entrepreneurial spirit. We work hard and play hard, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position requires the developer to work at EMG offices throughout this project’s duration on EMG supplied hardware. EMG offices are currently located in Culver City, CA. We will be moving to our new home towards the end of Q3 2012 which is at the Hercules Campus nearly 10 minutes from the current location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Job Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Candidate will have:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8+ years overall professional software development experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of PHP development experience (preferably recent experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with a relational database (preferably MySQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with design principles (patterns, cohesion/coupling, S.O.L.I.D.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Agile engineering practices (test driven development, continuous integration and pair programming, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptional familiarity with object oriented development principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability (and enthusiasm) in mentoring less experienced developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Prefer candidates who additionally possess:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering web development, all layers, from database services to user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Oriented JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with eCommerce development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with high-volume web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the development, deployment, and enhancement of RESTful APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in a medium or large corporate environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Senior Designer at Designkitchen in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not that you draw on everything – let’s just say that your friends know to keep napkins away from you when you’re out and about and that they have to wear long sleeves to keep your ever-handy Sharpies at bay. You’ve got the eye, though, and why should you stop? It makes you happier than anything to bring an idea to life. And that’s why we’ve got a blank canvas here at Designkitchen for you to scribble away on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Senior Designer, you’ll consistently generate presentation-grade work with minimal direction, owing to your intimate knowledge of the client’s business motives and requirements as well as your uncompromising attention to detail. What’s more, we’ll expect you to take the lead in many creative projects, mentoring other designers, photographers, illustrators, writers, and vendors as the team moves towards innovative solutions for a diverse array of clients. For this reason, you must have excellent collaborative and multitasking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll present work directly to clients, so brush up on those communication skills.

				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Why us: help solve hard problems that create real value for business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every website, mobile app, or marketing campaign has a social layer now, but too few companies make use of the incredibly valuable social data generated each day by their own users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm has built a powerful platform that captures these data, connects them to real business goals, and enables our customers to harness the results to create value through our growing toolset, robust APIs, and integrations with leading 3rd-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve proven the value of our technology to a growing number of real customers – from startups to the Fortune 500, and now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to grow our team, our capabilities, and the reach of our platform. Our goal is to help our customers harness the rich intent and effectiveness data from social interactions to build more compelling applications, produce more relevant content, and market more effectively – anywhere social is driving value, awe.sm can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the job: turning Big Data into Great Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are collecting enormous amounts of data, and are constantly coming up with new things we can do with it. Your job is to take the power of our APIs and focus it down into clear, easy-to-understand interfaces that help our customers see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and make use of that information to meet their goals. You&amp;rsquo;ll be extending our GUI as well as knocking out prototypes that demonstrate to customers all the ways they can use the data our platform can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to think creatively and come up with novel, illuminating interfaces that make the value of our data more obvious, easier, and more fun to use. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to be handing you a PSD and telling you to get all the pixels lined up; we&amp;rsquo;re going to be explaining a problem and looking to you for a solution that nobody&amp;rsquo;s tried before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who you are: excited just from the job description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an experienced developer with a proven track record of getting things done on the web. We&amp;rsquo;re also looking for someone deeply interested in user interface design and the presentation of information. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have built something in this area already, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a side project. We want somebody who uses JavaScript for more than form validation, and knows more than just jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all we&amp;rsquo;re looking for honest enthusiasm: does the idea of building big new things and having to learn a lot to get them done fill you with a burning desire to get started right away? Then you&amp;rsquo;re the person we need. We want somebody who has big ideas and the technical chops to bring them to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm works with hundreds of customers large and small, from startups like Zaarly, StockTwits, and Topspin Media to not-so-startups like Groupon, Zynga, and Gilt Groupe. We’re backed by leading VC firms and are expanding from a team of 5 to 10–15. The salary is competitive and comes with a generous stock option plan as well as full health, dental and vision coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a technology-driven business, we are creating an engineering-driven organization. Personal development is one of our highest company priorities, and we believe that technical development is essential to a strong engineering culture. That translates into code reviews and tech talks to promote learning and assigning projects in ways that help team-members explore their interests first-hand. We hope this will be your favorite job, but we doubt it will be your last and we want every member of our team to walk away from this experience better equipped to pursue their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current front-end code is mostly in PHP using the Zend Framework (we like MVC, but are not big fans of Ruby on Rails). We want somebody unafraid of learning new languages and APIs to get things done. Our user interface is HTML5 with a lot of Javascript for visualizations. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably be pleased to hear that we do not support IE 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a close-knit team. It should go without saying since we&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we work flexible hours in casual dress. We mostly work out of our offices on the 6th floor of the US Bank building in the Mission, featuring truly awesome views. We value our ability to concentrate, so we&amp;rsquo;re a pretty quiet room and everyone&amp;rsquo;s got headphones, but our IRC room is always active, with both technical arguments and the latest YouTube videos. We eat lunch together every day, and socialize after work regularly. We are increasingly good at throwing surprise birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buzzwords:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Must-haves:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML (including HTML5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (actual knowledge of the language, not just jQuery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-haves (in order of niceness):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC framework (especially Zend Framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook and Twitter APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Graphic Designer at Brafton in Boston, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Roles and responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Brafton Graphics Like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are passionate about information design and struggle to understand when numbers and stats are misrepresented. We research to discover narratives that become visually communicative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team our days revolve around deadlines, clients, team brainstorm sessions, critiques, a demanding schedule that values quality as much as turnaround and a workload that&amp;rsquo;s only for the strong. Oh and we also love puns and discovering narratives in random statistics. Still reading? Then we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of Boston&amp;rsquo;s Financial District, Brafton&amp;rsquo;s Graphics team has grown immensely since late 2011 when it was an army of two. Since then the team has grown to nine in total and with the influx of more work looks to add to that number. This is why the team has been one of the fastest growing and most innovating within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;THE JOB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Brafton Graphic Designer you will be responsible for working with our clients to create custom infographics. Graphics range from data-driven or brand-focused. Our designers are required to be proficient in research, aware of trends in social media and open to various topics that can range from fashion to finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;YOUR ROLE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer collaborates with the Design Manager, clients and various internal departments. Ideal candidates will be able to spearhead high design standards, provide excellent customer service and work on a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORE RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer is tasked with project production and delivery, including (but not limited to) the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing internet-based primary research for infographics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-time delivery of graphics to clients. Missed deadlines will NOT be tolerated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponding with clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally formatting whitepapers, case studies, brochures and one-pagers for clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required Competencies/Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earned a Degree in Graphic Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Adobe Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop (We run on CS6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with interactive design methods: HTML5, Java, After Effects, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Salesforce is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with project management system Basecamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter with strong attention to detail, including proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Gmail/Google Docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working with PCs&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Director, Planning and Strategy at WNET New York Public Media in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;American Masters, Thirteen/WNET’s award-winning biography series, celebrates our arts and culture. Created and launched in 1986 by Executive Producer Susan Lacy, the series set the standard for documentary film profiles, accruing widespread critical acclaim – 50 Emmy nominations and 23 awards – including for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 – the 2012 Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Producer of Non-Fiction Television; an Oscar, three Grammys and 12 Peabody Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Masters has produced an exceptional library of 180 titles, bringing unique originality and perspective to exploring the lives and illuminating the creative journeys of our most enduring writers, musicians, visual and performing artists, dramatists and filmmakers – those who have “left an indelible impression on our cultural landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the Executive Producer of American Masters, this newly created position is responsible for devising and implementing short- and long-range strategies for enlarging and stabilizing the American Masters franchise, with a senior role in both external and internal (WNET) initiatives and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director will be responsible for developing innovative thinking and forging relationships to further the reach and scope of the series beyond broadcast into the digital space, publishing, creative partnerships with universities, libraries and other organizations; for evaluating and activating renewed and original exploitation of the assets of the American Masters archive; for considering and planning new spin-offs, sub-sets, mini-series etc. based on existing and future American Masters programming &amp;ndash; all with an eye to maximizing the educational,digital, social media and revenue producing possibilities for both the existing library and future productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort will entail developing media and other creative partnerships&amp;mdash;both digital and analog, in film, production, literary and visual media&amp;mdash;as well as potential funding partners&amp;mdash;individuals, philanthropic and corporate&amp;mdash;including developing promotional tie-in and event opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director’s role will also entail coordination of all grant proposals to foundations, governmental organizations and PBS, collaborating closely with WNET Development staff. This individual will manage internal communications between the series and all relevant departments at WNET—the VP Programming, Interactive Engagement, Law, Human Resources, Station Relations, Communications, Program Publicity and especially Development and Major Gifts &amp;ndash;  and will be primarily responsible for working with Communications to coordinate press efforts, press releases and events, including screenings, station outreach events and the TCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the reach of the series through potential digital partnerships, this position will entail continued and expanded work with WNET&amp;rsquo;s in-house on-line and web department to enhance the work currently being done with the series programs, especially in the area of educational materials, DLOs etc. &amp;ndash; including finding the funding to support these expanded efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, candidates must possess a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff. Candidates must also have thorough knowledge of budgets and budget management; of rights and clearance issues; excellent oral and written communication skills; strong planning, organizational and relationship-building skills; knowledge of the independent production community; and ideally, some experience in fundraising. Familiarity with digital and online would be very desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidates with solid experience as executive or senior producer or in a development &amp;amp; planning role, in network, cable or independent production, with a successful history of developing projects, creating alliances, and fundraising – are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not a position for an active film-maker or would-be producer for American Masters – though film and production experience will be essential.  Rather, this is a critical senior administrative role in planning, strategy, communications and development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Required Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thorough knowledge of budgets and budget management; of rights and clearance issues; excellent oral and written communication skills; strong planning, organizational and relationship-building skills; knowledge of the independent production community; and ideally, some experience in fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior UX Designer, Yammer Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, we work on a product that is changing people&amp;rsquo;s lives at work. We believe that everyone deserves to use software that is useable, simple, and beautiful, whether they use it in their personal lives or for work. Yammer empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent, more equal way of doing their jobs. To change more lives at more companies, we&amp;rsquo;re now a part of Microsoft, but we run independently &amp;ndash; and quickly &amp;ndash; in London and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us lead the London edition of Yammer&amp;rsquo;s User Experience Team as chief user advocate. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a critical part of every London feature from conception to launch, working constantly with product management, research, engineering, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need designers who are great communicators and problem solvers with dead-on interaction instincts, but who know how visual UI design can affect the experience. We need both concise wireframes, and flawless visuals, but we know that they are separate skills and not mutually exclusive to create the best experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead the UX design process for product features that will be released in London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice a highly efficient, iterative design process with light documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide interaction/visual specification with visual styling, wireframes, workflow diagrams, and interactive mockups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate frequently with the UX Team in San Francisco to keep consistency with the user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of experience (or comparable) at various companies designing great consumer facing or enterprise products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed and launched multiple products/major features/apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with cross-functional teams in a rapid paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of technology advantages and limitations required (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise in Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle or Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work experience with user research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide production ready files to engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited not daunted by the fact that designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Front-end Developer at Harvest in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The role that JavaScript plays at Harvest is growing every day. You&amp;rsquo;ll join our front-end team in solving problems, building new features and making Harvest better and better. If you have experience with a nimble team where things progress rapidly then you&amp;rsquo;ll feel right at home at Harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest is a distributed team. We have a lovely big office in New York City, but team members live all over the USA, Canada and Europe. Wherever you currently live, that&amp;rsquo;s where we want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we mention a sense of humor yet? It&amp;rsquo;s important, we like to have fun while we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unrivaled attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing some extra work to make life easier on the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like writing CoffeeScript, but can write vanilla js without breaking a sweat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Backbone and Ember and have an opion on what makes them good/bad/meh. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve even built projects in both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know that performance is king and have optimized your code for a wide range of browsers and platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write code in a modular, reusable fashion. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve released open source code that demonstrates these qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe that a task is not complete until a test is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;A Sample of Tasks and Projects You Might Work On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build new Harvest features and improve existing components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a select box plugin for use in Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a cross-platform framework to support the mobile web component of Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a state manager for CSS media queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please make sure you fit the descriptions above (see the brain!). You must be authorized to work in the United States (unless you intend to work remotely from your home country).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email us at careers@getharvest.com with the subject &amp;ldquo;Harvest Front-end Developer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to work with us, and why you&amp;rsquo;d make a good fit here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us your thoughts on the eternal JavaScript debate: semicolons &amp;ndash; yes or no?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer - Yammer (Mobile/Android) Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media has dramatically changed the way we share and connect with friends and family, and it will have an even more profound impact on the way companies operate. Yammer and Microsoft provide a secure, private social network for your company. Yammer empowers employees to be more productive and successful by enabling them to collaborate easily, make smarter decisions faster, and self-organize into teams to take on any business challenge. It is a way of working that naturally drives business alignment and agility, reduces cycle times, engages employees and improves relationships with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know devices are the future; come help us design the future of great work software on Android-powered devices. We&amp;rsquo;re building a product that empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent way of doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yammer team is located in San Francisco, and we maintain the intensity, pragmatism, and velocity of a startup. We release product weekly and projects last weeks, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is structured around designers who are flexible, but who specialize in either visual/UI or interaction/UX. Our UI designers translate wireframes into pixel-perfect, typographically beautiful, development-ready visuals. Your visual designs and ideas are an integral part of what makes a feature stick. You&amp;rsquo;ll be part of feature project teams from the beginning until launch, working side-by-side with a product manager, UX designer, researcher, engineering team, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-3 years’ experience working, preferably at more than one past company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated understanding of Android’s User Interface Guidelines through completed design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise working daily in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide visual specification and production ready files to engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited that their designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic and possibly a little bit weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eager to move to a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UIDesigner at Litmus in Cambridge, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re bootstrapped, profitable and proud. You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with our team of
developers building cool stuff, with amazing people. Here&amp;rsquo;s what some of our 11
person crew have to say about Litmus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone. Gives. A. Shit. (about the tech, the products, the customers, each other). Trust and ownership are important here. We build products that scratch our own itch. We experiment, we celebrate (big things (like throwing a launch party), and small (beers at the end of the week)). Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s no red tape, bullshit posturing, timecards or org charts!&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Eddie, Ruby Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aside from software architecture and syntax, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a task that I have begun that I have known how to do. It is a constant learning experience and we often times find ourselves building things that have never been built before.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justin, C# Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re in charge of our own future and aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden by a board, investors or anyone else. I feel like the people I work for care more for our customers and their employees than most other companies do.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justine, Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Super cool office! &amp;ndash; Our office is amazing and we do a lot of cool things here. Kinect + beer fridays + fun :) It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to get to and a great location.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Danielle, Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &quot;founders&amp;rdquo; are in the thick of it. Also, the collective responsibility, I feel like I could rely on any team member for help.&amp;ldquo;
&lt;strong&gt;James, Account Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About The Position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer everything you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cutting edge, financially successful start
up. Great salary, full health care benefits, 28 days paid vacation (yes, on top of
public holidays!), beautiful office space complete with a Kinect, beer fridge and
Sonos sound system. We also buy you lunch, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the very best money can buy: SSD drives, dual Apple
Displays, Aeron chairs, huge desks, 10&quot; tablets and whatever else you need to be
awesome at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention our office? Seconds from the Central Square T in Cambridge, we have the 11th floor to ourselves. Stunning views, beautiful furniture and top of the line equipment. You have to see it; it&amp;rsquo;s stunning. Design is a key selling point of our products. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone to take over responsibility for all aspects of design and user experience at Litmus. We&amp;rsquo;ll give you all the resources and support you need to craft beautiful, elegant experiences that delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing the user interfaces for all our web-based products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working closely with our development team to oversee the implementation of your designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-ordinating user testing of our product and your own prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping in to help with user experience decisions whenever they arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The ideal candidate has:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio showcasing excellent skills in design and UX principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of layout, typography, color and other design principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Watch our &lt;a href=&quot;http://litmus.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Meet the team&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; video.&lt;br/&gt;

				<title>UI Engineer / FrontEndDeveloper at Hearsay Social in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who knows what makes a website look and behave well and also has the random set of skills to actually
make it happen. Someone who is so OCD that she even wants her code to look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who understands that there are living, breathing people at the other end of the tube. They’re impatient.
They read very little. Sometimes they use ancient devices that you wouldn’t touch with a 10 foot pole, but hey they’re your guests and you’re open-minded so you accommodate them. If they can’t figure something out, it&amp;rsquo;s not their fault; it&amp;rsquo;s your fault for building a confusing application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer you believe less is more. You deconstruct a page to its most crucial elements (after figuring out what the most crucial elements are). You show and don’t tell. You realize that we are building a business application and not (thank God) a consumer daily deal site. As such, our site should be timelessly elegant without being trendy. You are consistently consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you want every page to load in a snap. You know that all those &lt;strong&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/strong&gt; cause the browser to chug-a-lug so you use &lt;strong&gt;CSS3 for the bling and kiss the PNGs goodbye&lt;/strong&gt;. You have a visceral reaction to any text that’s part of an image (excepting, of course, logos) because you know it isn&amp;rsquo;t scalable or translatable. Your markup is clean and semantic. You know the difference between &lt;strong&gt;display block, inline and inline-block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what it’s good for but you also know when not to use it. You prefer the &lt;strong&gt;acronym XHR to the misnomer AJAX because it should really be called AJAJ&lt;/strong&gt;. You like to experiment with new paradigms like Backbone but ultimately know it’s just one of many different implementations; it’s the thing you’re implementing that’s important not the technology that gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You secretly know that front end development is harder than back end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-end Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful
ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing
channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way:
organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more
downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as
app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a
slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of
user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong
opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in
everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your
HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire
employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it&lt;/em&gt;. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part
of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying
customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to
becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well compensated&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation
package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome team&lt;/em&gt;. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include
sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Mobile Developer (Android &amp; iOS) at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Developer &amp;ndash; Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect of mobile and web games&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android development experience using cross platform tools. i.e. creating one code base that can be compiled for both Android and iOS on same platform a plus, e.g. use of LiveCode, Marmalade, Corona&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to take initiative to be productive and efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to work independently and within a team, depending on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires hands-on architecting, designing, and coding new features on IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate with team members in design reviews and code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of development experience in IOS and/or Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ yrs of object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen Poker Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We currently have demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Android and iOS Mobile Developers at CSC in Cincinnati, OH</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;CSC (www.csc.com), one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative and successful IT services firms, is looking for candidates to help grow our talented consulting team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for individuals who:
* Strive for excellence in everything they do
* Bring a partnering approach to their job
* Focus on the innovative use of technology to overcome business challenges
* Seek to work in a environment that respects individual ideas and diversity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we are seeking to hire Mobility developers with deep skills in Android to work with clients to design and deliver solutions that meet their specific business objectives. You will leverage and grow your knowledge and skills in a fast-paced, rewarding environment &amp;mdash; working side-by-side with our team of world class consultants.  In addition to a rewarding work environment, CSC offers an outstanding set of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a Sr. Android developer with 3 to 5 years of commercial experience in developing software solutions with a focus on user interface design.   Ideal candidate will have developed 10+ apps on a professional basis, either for individual sale or for enterprise customers. Experience in iOS and HTML5 development a big plus.  You will be working with a team of User Experience professionals and Solution Architects to deliver mobile application (BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company:  CSC (www.csc.com) is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading providers of information technology services, helping organizations achieve business results through the effective use of technology. Since its formation in 1959, CSC has earned a customer-centric reputation for developing and managing solutions specifically tailored to each client&amp;rsquo;s needs. No other company offers the same range of professional services and global reach as CSC does in areas such as business and technology strategies, management consulting, information systems consulting and integration, application software, and IT and business process outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSC is a leading provider of management and information technology services to commercial and government markets in over 90 countries.  Our consulting portfolio spans the full life cycle &amp;ndash; from strategy and business process design to technology services, systems integration, application outsourcing and hosting.  Our clients benefit from the breadth and depth of our global expertise, but more importantly, CSC goes to market using a team of local experts, creating a relaxed, professional-casual atmosphere, while maintaining a family and people-oriented culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we right for you?  CSC offers a variety of challenging opportunities that will draw on your talents while enabling you to grow your intellectual capital in a supportive environment.  Learning experiences are offered as a blend of relevant work assignments, training, tools, mentoring and other growth opportunities.  We offer many avenues to mastering your chosen profession, while giving you everyday exposure to brilliance in business, technology and people.  As one employee puts it &amp;ldquo;you have the freedom to explore different technologies, the mobility to move from one role to another (or one country to another), and the possibilities of learning from 92,000 colleagues worldwide &amp;ndash; without changing employer or losing benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career Advancement:  Your career belongs to you. At CSC, we recognize that you are in control of identifying and achieving your career goals.  CSC enables you to take the lead through our formal development planning process.  We will help you create a plan for enhancing your skills and experience by providing information, tools, and people that will support your career planning efforts.  We have identified over 60 standard roles that exist across CSC Consulting, as well as the corresponding skills needed to succeed in those roles.  You can use this information to identify your next assignment or an entire career path anywhere in the U.S. or potentially the world.  A career at CSC can be as targeted or eclectic as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectation for Travel:  For the Global Business Solutions division of CSC, all roles require a commitment to 100% travel.  This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a person will always be traveling for assignments, but new Consultants joining the CSC team need to understand that they could be assigned to a travel role.  The staffing process focuses on assigning people to local roles as a first priority, however, if a Consultant is available and has the right skills for an assignment for another CSC office across the United States, the Consultant may be staffed into that travel assignment.  When this happens, they travel to the project location at the start of the week, return at the end of the work week and are home during the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Below is the generic description for this position:&lt;/h2&gt;

				<title>Senior Applications Developer at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Sr. Applications Developer &amp;amp; Systems Specialist * Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect or advanced developer  of mobile or web games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands technology trade-offs for development platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience building native web and mobile apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced developing  with rich media and interactive web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with the majority of: JavaScript, HTML(5), CSS3, JSON, Jquery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced in object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recently demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a windows shop. However, ff you have an open source background and consider youself the agnostic type with a high stadard for making quality, scalable software, then we&amp;rsquo;d love to connect with and tell you more details surrounding the greatest technology challenge of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Funding &amp;amp; The Legalization of Online Poker in California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is underway and funded by a well-known and big Native American casino. This is an important point because the proposed law states that in order to run an online poker system you must already hold a gaming license in CA. The tribe will also provide the $35-40M required to obtain the license when the licensing process is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legalization of online poker in California is anticipated to be enacted in 2013 with the ability to open the online poker room either in late 2013 or early 2014. The bill for legalization is known as CA Senate Bill 51 which was introduced by Senator Roderick Wright on Dec 21, 2012. It was first introduced by on 2/24/12 as SB 1463 before being withdrawn several months later.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Developer at StudentsFirst in Sacramento, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a national grassroots movement of more than 2 million parents, teachers, students, administrators and concerned citizens mobilizing for one purpose: to put the laws and leaders in place to make students the focus of and ensure America has the best schools in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things the old way for too long.  Pitting the interests of the grown-ups in the system against one another, for example, rather than focusing on real solutions.  No one won. And students lost.  In too many American schools, current laws, policies, and practices are putting adult interests ahead of students. The result is an increasingly broken education system that, if not corrected, will keep America from leading in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new approach that puts students' interests at the center of education policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are channeling the energy of our members to produce meaningful results on both the local and national level. We are working with bipartisan state legislators to create laws and policies that put the needs of students above any other interest in the system. Our members are pushing for reforms that will elevate the teaching profession and improve teacher and principal quality, empower parents and improve the governance and financial strength of school districts. Together, we’ve already helped pass more than 50 new policies in half a dozen states. We have helped improve education systems affecting millions of students. We’re transforming public education to ensure great teachers and great schools for all of our kids. StudentsFirst was founded in 2010 by former Washington D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee.&lt;/p&gt;
