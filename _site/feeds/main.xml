				<title>Senior Operations Developer at Aweber Communications in Chalfont, PA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Role:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senior Operations Developer role focuses on pushing forward efforts in system automation and deployment using tools like Chef and Puppet, building REST APIs using Python frameworks like Flask and Tornado, and researching new solutions to help drive platform innovation in any part of the organization. The role also participates in many other initiatives, not the least of which is solidifying and furthering our commitment to collaboration and cooperation between development and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A sampling of the types of projects performed by this role might include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building out event-oriented message queuing architectures to increase efficiency and open data streams to multiple applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and/or build new solutions to provide new services and functionality to the internal application platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate and expand the collection and use of metrics, leveraging new &amp;amp; existing tools to provide visualizations to both business and technical parts of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;You:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re an experienced engineer. You’ve worked on multiple projects in various environments. You’ve put things into production, you’ve had people use them, you’ve failed, you’ve succeeded, you’ve paid your dues, and learned your lessons. You have a passion for technology, and view what you do as a craft. You like your job, but love your work. It’s something you’d do (and have done) even if there were no money or job involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You enjoy working with open source languages, toolchains, systems, and databases, and are always seeking out new solutions to difficult problems. Where those solutions are found lacking, you contribute, and occasionally build your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cringe at the thought of having to make a definitive choice between doing only software engineering or only systems engineering. You like to have your hands in all of it, and to be able to understand and affect change to any part of your work, front end to back end. You strongly resist pigeonholing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thrive in environments where technological and innovative velocity is high, and the overhead from administrivia is low. You can work well in isolation, but are happy to collaborate in a team setting, and might not even mind doing the occasional pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWeber’s engineering team is a dynamic and exciting place to be. We use open source technologies like PostgreSQL, Python, MongoDB, Redis, Riak, Chef, Ruby, Graphite, and RabbitMQ. We use approaches to software quality like Test-Driven Development, Continuous Deployment, and a healthy addiction to metrics that give us insight into our applications, and how well they’re serving our customers.

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work must be beautiful, usable, and tell a story. We love digging into complex and messy problems because that&amp;rsquo;s our opportunity to tease a little order out of the chaos. We work with other designers, developers, financial analysts, and our clients to set new standards for information design. This work is widely used, billions of views each day (that’s billion, with a ‘b’), so what you do here matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exciting, right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a team of over 30 designers, and as business continues to grow, so do we. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for people who can create compelling experiences, who live and die by the grid, and who can see a story in a thousand data points. The skills we employ include everything from user research, information architecture and wireframes to pixel-perfect interactive comps. We hope Adobe Creative Suite is an extension of your hands, you know enough CSS to be dangerous and maybe even play around in Processing from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Still interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This might be your kind of place if you&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think design lies in the intentionally imperfect union of form and function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can tell us a story through numbers alone. Or chopsticks for that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovered Tufte and realized you weren&amp;rsquo;t alone in your obsession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Oh, and us? How nice of you to ask. We&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t love cubicles. Or barriers of any kind really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blush when clients call us data geeks, or tell us we&amp;rsquo;re detail obsessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are equally fascinated by Radiolab and Planet Money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;On top of the good stuff like competitive salaries, health insurance, and 401k, there's…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting paid to bike, bus or carpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlimited chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time to work on what you want (like that crazy idea you have been dreaming about for months).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;So if you think you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit here, send us…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your résumé. We need to see how well you color inside the lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your portfolio, Dribbble link or any other work examples. Coloring outside the lines is encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a link to your favorite data visualization and what about it resonates with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>iOS Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who deeply understands the bleeding edge of the Apple frameworks from the bare metal on up to the higher level APIs? Are you outrageously detail oriented? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible with iOS since late 2008 with mobile computer vision apps like RedLaser (acquired by eBay in 2010) and 360 Panorama. We&amp;rsquo;re not just an &amp;ldquo;app company.&amp;rdquo; We strive to change the world through our products and their underlying state-of-the-art computer vision technology, all of which is built from scratch by our broadly-talented team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need someone who knows exactly what the Apple iOS SDK is doing under the covers and can help us build innovative computer vision applications the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the text of an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough knowledge of memory management on iOS is ingrained in you. You can optimize the memory footprint of an app, avoid memory leaks like the plague, and you know what NSZombieEnabled is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can recite the exact setup / teardown process that UIKit follows for UIViewController and UIViews in your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve worked with AV Foundation, know what YCbCr is, and perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve even written a camera-based application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built a game or other graphics-based app using Open GL ES 2.0 and think pixel shaders are the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built an app that is live on the App Store that we can try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing.

&lt;li&gt;Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more.

				<title>Front-End Developer at Occipital in Boulder, CO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When you see a terrible UI do you have a hundred ideas on how you could do it better? Does creating next-gen user experiences get you out of bed in the morning? Are you so detailed oriented that an unwanted single pixel offset bugs you? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Occipital, we love creating amazing user-experiences on the web that work for all common browsers, but we also love pushing the envelope with the latest tech. With 360 Panorama, for example, we created an interactive viewer that works across almost every browser, but we also added gyro support for the mobile safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve just started scratching the surface of what’s possible with the font-end web, and we will do a lot more. The experiences we create around our computer vision powered products are brand new and require next-gen interfaces &amp;ndash; we want someone who can help us bring these experiences to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do most of the following apply to you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real artists ship &amp;ndash; You have a strong desire to help build something that is the best in the world and ship it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details matter &amp;ndash; You believe everything should have a reason, down to the placement of a button and the size of a text field, even if that reason is that it looks better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience above all else &amp;ndash; You’ll deal with things like browser compatibility issues in an elegant way to make sure users on all popular browsers have a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an active Github account and can show us some code you are proud of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can tap into a user’s sensorimotor cortex to create Natural User Interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write bulletproof, well-commented and reusable Javascript and know when to use libraries like jQuery and when to just write something custom for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve built something with WebGL and have tons of ideas on how to take advantage of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to push the asynchronous envelope with Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with Python/Django.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve built something using maps or geo data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe 3D is a big part of the future, and you like to subtly integrate it into normal 2D web experiences, but then go all out when you’ve got HTML5 and WebGL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience building something non-trivial using Flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to join the team that’s building the future of Augmented Reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Director Customer Support at Hulu in Los Angeles, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Hulu Support team is dedicated to providing customer support so awesome that it will make users’ heads spin. Seriously. Our goal is to be the absolute best in the world at what we do, and this is a challenge we do not take lightly. We send emails in prose, tweet troubleshooting steps in less than 140 characters, and answer calls so fast users haven’t realized the phone was ringing. We call this “the support we wish we got everywhere else”, and as we go about providing it, we’re looking for a Director of Customer Support to help us take our goals to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be joining a creative and exciting technology company that is on a strong growth trajectory &amp;mdash; we&amp;rsquo;ve been ahead of expectations in all measures of success since our founding in 2007. We pride ourselves on adding people to the team who can perform at a high level while exercising impeccable judgment. You know the type – they are intellectually curious, relentless in their pursuit of better ways, and possess an atypically high attention to detail. We trust them to do the right thing, give them the resources necessary to do so, and try to have some fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Director of Customer Support, you will be reporting to the VP of Product Development. While you will assume leadership of current day-to-day activities, your mission will be to establish Hulu as the customer support organization others want to replicate. This challenge will involve managing the continued growth of the organization, refining the customer support strategy, scaling to additional locations in the US, and building the tools and processes needed to implement that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other core responsibilities will include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exemplifying the Hulu culture on a daily basis, and fostering it in your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining and driving the ongoing development of Hulu&amp;rsquo;s customer support strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing on continual improvement of self-help and live-support tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping each team member grow and develop, while merging individual players into a motivated and passionate team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing the CSA leadership team, and mentoring in core management skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying and communicating key feedback trends to Product and Development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring and training the right people to grow a high performing customer support team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing quality of service metrics that ensure a premium-quality customer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Leading from the front&amp;rsquo; by pitching in and responding to customer contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remaining flexible in your schedule, as we intend to provide 24/7 support in the next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just anyone gets to be part of Hulu. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a proven leader who has developed and motivated people, and shaped strong performing teams. While experience working in media and/or technology companies is helpful, we think it&amp;rsquo;s also valuable to have had exposure to multiple industries. Of course it will help to have experience building and scaling CS teams, but just as important, you must demonstrate rabid passion for customers and an understanding that customer support is really both a form of direct marketing and a valuable source of product feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in managing, mentoring and motivating high-performing teams in a constructive manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence, high energy, and a proven ability to drive results under pressure and in the face of ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analytical mindset and a relentless drive to find innovative ways to improve processes and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid understanding of web technology and support challenges in the tech industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of call center operations and best practices, but also the ability to develop a team that can resolve issues without relying on scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with multiple support channels, including an understanding of the scalability and cost effectiveness of web channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing multiple support locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A background in marketing and turning customers into brand ambassadors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;QUESTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think you’ve got what it takes? Well, Pop Quiz Hotshot, please take a minute to answer the next two questions, and send them in along with your resume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Question 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are brief descriptions of two scenarios someone might have as a customer out in “the real world”. Please choose one of them, put yourself in the shoes of that person, and write a review about what the experience was like (something like a Yelp review). There’s no right or wrong scenario to choose, so don’t spend too much time psychoanalyzing your choice. All we ask is that you keep your response shorter than 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scenario A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting a new doctor’s office for the first time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The receptionist at the front desk was snooty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You arrived on time, but had to wait 47 minutes until the doctor saw you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doctor was super friendly, and had amazing bedside manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only available parking garage cost $15 per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were promised test results by the next day, but never received them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Scenario B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking out the brand new restaurant on the block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You walked in at 7PM on a Friday night, and were quoted a 45 minute wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The host was super friendly and apologetic for the long delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 5 minutes, the manager found you outside to let you know a table had opened up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During your meal, the server delivered the wrong drink order (twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the check came, you noticed the drinks had been taken off the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now picture this. You’re managing a team of CSAs, but decide to jump in the queue to stay current on customer contacts. Please write what you would consider to be the ideal response to the following customer&amp;rsquo;s questions. Basically, rock their world like you’d expect your team to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Hulu,
I recently became a Hulu Plus subscriber but I have two quick questions. First, even though I&amp;rsquo;m paying, why am I still seeing commercials that stutter? Secondly, will I be able to watch all the episodes of The Big Bang Theory and The Office on my TV and iPhone at the same time with Hulu Plus?
Thanks for your help!
Bucky&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to push the boundaries of what’s possible in web technology to help build the future of augmented reality? Are you able to hold a complete understanding of a complex backend system in your head to build fast and reliable web applications and APIs? Do you have a deep understanding of how networking, databases, and servers work down to the bare metal? Then we really want to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re creating a computer vision platform to power the next generation of augmented reality. This is an incredibly complex endeavor that will require everything from sophisticated computer vision algorithms running on mobile devices, to vast storage of visual information, to taking advantage of GPU servers for fast parallel image processing. An important part of this platform will be the web backend system required to tie it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our currently launched product, 360 Panorama, has millions of users and huge potential that we have yet to tap. 360 Panorama users are helping us build the 360VERSE &amp;ndash; a way to explore the world through 360 views, searchable by location AND time (currently in beta, launching soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a web wizard who is excited to help us expand on 360 Panorama and 360VERSE and also help us build the computer vision platform that will usher in a new wave of augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If you have experience with most of the following, we’d love to talk to you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python or other server side scripting language experience (most of our backend is written in Python)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC frameworks (we use Django)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js (used on our GPU servers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres or other SQL experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geospatial / location search using PostGIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*nix server administration and automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of cloud services, including storage and server provisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of front-end technologies (e.g. Javascript, HTML5, WebGL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and ability to debug the full web stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of networking protocols and ability to implement and design new ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;iCrossing is looking for a Art Director for their Chicago office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a designer. You live and breathe design and have the portfolio to support it. You are an entrepreneur. You have the innate ability to manage projects, people and client expectations. A designer with a knack for marketing – it all comes together in the Art Director role at iCrossing’s San Francisco office. You’ll provide forward-thinking creative leadership and inspire creative collaboration within our agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a trained eye on challenging the industry status quo, you’ll be continually engaged in delivering outstanding work on projects large and small, from web engagements to display advertising and internal promotions to external presentations. Equally comfortable leading a team of designers, presenting to clients, and defining strategy, you’ll also get to keep your own creative muscles flexed as you personally create and design for our ever-expanding list of Fortune 500 clients. Adjectives used to describe your creative work…killer, award-winning, re-defining, how did they do that? Adjectives to describe your management skills…cool, calm, organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide forward-thinking creative leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspire creative collaboration across the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively translate branding and marketing strategies for a wide range of clients/verticals into exceptional creative concepts and executions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and create innovative concepts in keeping with project scope: strategic positioning, business requirements, timelines, and budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead design team in delivery of outstanding design for all-things digital: large scale web engagements, online advertising, digital marketing, business development initiatives, brand boards, and video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve as mentor to design team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare creative deliverables (brand boards, creative comps, and style guides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present creative concepts internally and externally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage entire creative process and large-scale projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4-year degree in a related field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4 years in a leadership role in an interactive, design, or advertising agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven success in online and offline media delivered in an impressive portfolio of work (electronic submission or URL preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent display of interest and involvement in the industry. Applicants are encouraged to include links/references to relevant activities that help round out their experience and&lt;/li&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to build software that matters? Do you want to work with a brilliant engineering team that really cares that users love their software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppFolio is a fast growing and funded startup in Santa Barbara, CA that is focused on building exciting web-based business applications that customers rave about. We take pride in finding new ways to delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will join our engineering team to design and build user interfaces that are used millions of times each month and help to make people&amp;rsquo;s lives a little bit better. Although all our engineers work across the entire development stack, we are looking to hire specialists specifically in the front-end who can provide expert level guidance to our team and stay on top of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We are looking for people with expert-level proficiency in:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (and libraries like jQuery, Modernizr, Backbone, Underscore, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-browser support and progressive enhancement&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You’ve downloaded and installed nightly builds of Chrome, Webkit, and Firefox just to try out new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t just use JavaScript libraries, you know how they work. You’ve probably submitted patches to popular libraries or even built your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML semantics is important to you; you’d never have a hard time deciding between using a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;ul&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a solid understanding of CSS selector specificity and you don’t resort to just adding another ID to make one rule trump another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;If you have one or more of the skills below, even better:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer at KIXEYE in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;KIXEYE is currently looking for a kick-ass UX Designer. You’ll get to work with all our game teams, as well as help support our new platform. You’ll be responsible for requirements gathering and creating wireframes/flows to support our UI team in the creation of assets for all of our products. It also goes without saying that you need to fight for the user day in and day out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you get to do everyday:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide comprehensive designs for all our games’ new features, specifying layout, functionality, and flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather design requirements from appropriate stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocate and lead UX discussions; achieve best-possible designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive design thinking and champion the UX vision across the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brainstorm, research, wireframe, design and refine user experiences within product requirements and deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other designers, program managers, and engineering teams, working to prioritize UX design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create wireframes, workflow diagrams, mockups and design specifications required for proper implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you bring to the role:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience in applied UX design,  Strong written and verbal communication skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid portfolio demonstrating your UX skills with examples of process used on projects (please specify work done individually or with a team)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A passion for UX and keeping current with recent usability trends and best of practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Visio or other UX wireframing tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be comfortable with a motion driven process. UX design is highly iterative and includes multiple rounds of brainstorming and revisions to find the perfect solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptional communication skills with the ability to present and explain UX ideas and concepts effectively whether verbally, written or through visuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open minded and collaborative approach to UX with the ability to take direction and constructive feedback and use it to create easy to use solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to produce in a fast paced environment with a dedication to iterate in pursuit of the best UX solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-motivated worker with ability to prioritize and manage work load to meet critical project deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desire to grow your skill sets and broaden your experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of humor. Or, openness to the occasional, unsolicited dick/fart joke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an avid gamer! Live and breathe games!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Stuff that helps:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undergraduate degree or equivalent certificates in interaction design, industrial design, graphic design, or other UX design-related field; Master’s degree preferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in a game development team as a user interface designer, artist, or game designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong communication and presentation skills; ability to present design solutions for game UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong project management skills; ability to manage schedules and identify project needs and priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong knowledge of PC and console games; familiarity with MMO and shooter games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands on familiarity with Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art skills—not required, but nice to have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands on familiarity with HTML and CS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Senior PHP Developer at Earthbound Media Group in Irvine, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Scope of Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG is seeking a Sr. PHP Developer to augment our progressive team of engineers. The position is for long term contract (6+ months) with intent to move to a permanent position within our company. The project we are hiring for could quite possibly be one of the coolest projects you have ever worked on. It combines front-end development with hardware integration within the entertainment industry. EMG will be using a true agile sprint planning process. This position is one among a project team of 4+ developers for this particular project. There will also be a mid-level PHP developer that you will work side-by-side with. No matter what level of engineer you are hired as, there is an expectation that you will teach and learn from your peers and teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG offers a wide array of technical projects to work on in various languages and platforms, each with a different challenge. Our environment is set up so that our developers can touch a little bit of everything for their own experience, and that also enables EMG to deliver high quality products for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All employees of EMG must be positive with a “can do” attitude. The ability to understand risks and time/scope implications and be able to communicate those to your Director of Technology is required. There is not one person at EMG that does not have an entrepreneurial spirit. We work hard and play hard, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position requires the developer to work at EMG offices throughout this project’s duration on EMG supplied hardware. EMG offices are currently located in Culver City, CA. We will be moving to our new home towards the end of Q3 2012 which is at the Hercules Campus nearly 10 minutes from the current location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Job Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Candidate will have:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8+ years overall professional software development experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years of PHP development experience (preferably recent experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with a relational database (preferably MySQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with design principles (patterns, cohesion/coupling, S.O.L.I.D.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Agile engineering practices (test driven development, continuous integration and pair programming, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptional familiarity with object oriented development principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability (and enthusiasm) in mentoring less experienced developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Prefer candidates who additionally possess:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering web development, all layers, from database services to user interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Oriented JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with eCommerce development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with high-volume web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the development, deployment, and enhancement of RESTful APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in a medium or large corporate environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Senior Designer at Designkitchen in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not that you draw on everything – let’s just say that your friends know to keep napkins away from you when you’re out and about and that they have to wear long sleeves to keep your ever-handy Sharpies at bay. You’ve got the eye, though, and why should you stop? It makes you happier than anything to bring an idea to life. And that’s why we’ve got a blank canvas here at Designkitchen for you to scribble away on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Senior Designer, you’ll consistently generate presentation-grade work with minimal direction, owing to your intimate knowledge of the client’s business motives and requirements as well as your uncompromising attention to detail. What’s more, we’ll expect you to take the lead in many creative projects, mentoring other designers, photographers, illustrators, writers, and vendors as the team moves towards innovative solutions for a diverse array of clients. For this reason, you must have excellent collaborative and multitasking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll present work directly to clients, so brush up on those communication skills. An expert in design software, you’ll also be expected to know your way around HTML/dHTML, CMS, CSS, Audio/Video and Flash within all web, mobile and tablet applications. At the top of our design team, we’ll need you to stay sharp on trends and take the initiative to wow our clients with your napkin doodling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A couple keys to a successful Senior Designer…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience across channels (digital, direct, print, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance and banking experience a plus but not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great concepter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great collaborator – works with Planning, UX, Content, Technology and Account teams to execute exceptional work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizational and time management skills – can work on multiple projects and manage multiple deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to inspire teamwork and take a leadership role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic understanding of HTML5/dHTML, CSS, CMS, audio/video, mobile and all flash capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert use of Photoshop and Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompromising attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor and advise other designers, direct photographers, illustrators, writers, and/or other vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;About us:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designkitchen is a creative digital agency and part of Wunderman, a subsidiary of Y&amp;amp;R (WPP).

But we also want developers who know when to slow down, get input from other people on the team, and make sure that what they&amp;rsquo;re building today will accelerate what we need to do tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You’ll get a gold star and a commemorative calendar if you:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to implement and use Android Intent-based services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable with hybrid online/offline designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement background tasks that don’t suck battery life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiently query and manage large data sets on mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the Android UI guidelines but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited by them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have something to say about security, both on-device and off-device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can talk knowledgeably about structured and unstructured data and how people interact with such data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have done work with iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, or other mobile platforms in addition to Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In your cover letter, please tell us about one mobile app that you really admire and one thing you think that app should have done differently.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>UI Developer at awe.sm in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Why us: help solve hard problems that create real value for business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every website, mobile app, or marketing campaign has a social layer now, but too few companies make use of the incredibly valuable social data generated each day by their own users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm has built a powerful platform that captures these data, connects them to real business goals, and enables our customers to harness the results to create value through our growing toolset, robust APIs, and integrations with leading 3rd-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve proven the value of our technology to a growing number of real customers – from startups to the Fortune 500, and now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to grow our team, our capabilities, and the reach of our platform. Our goal is to help our customers harness the rich intent and effectiveness data from social interactions to build more compelling applications, produce more relevant content, and market more effectively – anywhere social is driving value, awe.sm can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the job: turning Big Data into Great Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are collecting enormous amounts of data, and are constantly coming up with new things we can do with it. Your job is to take the power of our APIs and focus it down into clear, easy-to-understand interfaces that help our customers see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and make use of that information to meet their goals. You&amp;rsquo;ll be extending our GUI as well as knocking out prototypes that demonstrate to customers all the ways they can use the data our platform can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to think creatively and come up with novel, illuminating interfaces that make the value of our data more obvious, easier, and more fun to use. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to be handing you a PSD and telling you to get all the pixels lined up; we&amp;rsquo;re going to be explaining a problem and looking to you for a solution that nobody&amp;rsquo;s tried before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who you are: excited just from the job description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an experienced developer with a proven track record of getting things done on the web. We&amp;rsquo;re also looking for someone deeply interested in user interface design and the presentation of information. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have built something in this area already, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a side project. We want somebody who uses JavaScript for more than form validation, and knows more than just jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all we&amp;rsquo;re looking for honest enthusiasm: does the idea of building big new things and having to learn a lot to get them done fill you with a burning desire to get started right away? Then you&amp;rsquo;re the person we need. We want somebody who has big ideas and the technical chops to bring them to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awe.sm works with hundreds of customers large and small, from startups like Zaarly, StockTwits, and Topspin Media to not-so-startups like Groupon, Zynga, and Gilt Groupe. We’re backed by leading VC firms and are expanding from a team of 5 to 10–15. The salary is competitive and comes with a generous stock option plan as well as full health, dental and vision coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a technology-driven business, we are creating an engineering-driven organization. Personal development is one of our highest company priorities, and we believe that technical development is essential to a strong engineering culture. That translates into code reviews and tech talks to promote learning and assigning projects in ways that help team-members explore their interests first-hand. We hope this will be your favorite job, but we doubt it will be your last and we want every member of our team to walk away from this experience better equipped to pursue their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current front-end code is mostly in PHP using the Zend Framework (we like MVC, but are not big fans of Ruby on Rails). We want somebody unafraid of learning new languages and APIs to get things done. Our user interface is HTML5 with a lot of Javascript for visualizations. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably be pleased to hear that we do not support IE 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a close-knit team. It should go without saying since we&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we work flexible hours in casual dress. We mostly work out of our offices on the 6th floor of the US Bank building in the Mission, featuring truly awesome views. We value our ability to concentrate, so we&amp;rsquo;re a pretty quiet room and everyone&amp;rsquo;s got headphones, but our IRC room is always active, with both technical arguments and the latest YouTube videos. We eat lunch together every day, and socialize after work regularly. We are increasingly good at throwing surprise birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buzzwords:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Must-haves:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML (including HTML5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (actual knowledge of the language, not just jQuery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-haves (in order of niceness):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC framework (especially Zend Framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook and Twitter APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;h2&gt;Roles and responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Brafton Graphics Like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are passionate about information design and struggle to understand when numbers and stats are misrepresented. We research to discover narratives that become visually communicative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team our days revolve around deadlines, clients, team brainstorm sessions, critiques, a demanding schedule that values quality as much as turnaround and a workload that&amp;rsquo;s only for the strong. Oh and we also love puns and discovering narratives in random statistics. Still reading? Then we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of Boston&amp;rsquo;s Financial District, Brafton&amp;rsquo;s Graphics team has grown immensely since late 2011 when it was an army of two. Since then the team has grown to nine in total and with the influx of more work looks to add to that number. This is why the team has been one of the fastest growing and most innovating within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

Our designers are required to be proficient in research, aware of trends in social media and open to various topics that can range from fashion to finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;YOUR ROLE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer collaborates with the Design Manager, clients and various internal departments. Ideal candidates will be able to spearhead high design standards, provide excellent customer service and work on a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CORE RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphic Designer is tasked with project production and delivery, including (but not limited to) the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing internet-based primary research for infographics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-time delivery of graphics to clients. Missed deadlines will NOT be tolerated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corresponding with clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally formatting whitepapers, case studies, brochures and one-pagers for clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required Competencies/Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earned a Degree in Graphic Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Adobe Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop (We run on CS6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with interactive design methods: HTML5, Java, After Effects, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Salesforce is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with project management system Basecamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter with strong attention to detail, including proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Gmail/Google Docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working with PCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Director, Planning and Strategy at WNET New York Public Media in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;American Masters, Thirteen/WNET’s award-winning biography series, celebrates our arts and culture. Created and launched in 1986 by Executive Producer Susan Lacy, the series set the standard for documentary film profiles, accruing widespread critical acclaim – 50 Emmy nominations and 23 awards – including for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 – the 2012 Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Producer of Non-Fiction Television; an Oscar, three Grammys and 12 Peabody Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Masters has produced an exceptional library of 180 titles, bringing unique originality and perspective to exploring the lives and illuminating the creative journeys of our most enduring writers, musicians, visual and performing artists, dramatists and filmmakers – those who have “left an indelible impression on our cultural landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the Executive Producer of American Masters, this newly created position is responsible for devising and implementing short- and long-range strategies for enlarging and stabilizing the American Masters franchise, with a senior role in both external and internal (WNET) initiatives and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director will be responsible for developing innovative thinking and forging relationships to further the reach and scope of the series beyond broadcast into the digital space, publishing, creative partnerships with universities, libraries and other organizations; for evaluating and activating renewed and original exploitation of the assets of the American Masters archive; for considering and planning new spin-offs, sub-sets, mini-series etc. based on existing and future American Masters programming &amp;ndash; all with an eye to maximizing the educational,digital, social media and revenue producing possibilities for both the existing library and future productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort will entail developing media and other creative partnerships&amp;mdash;both digital and analog, in film, production, literary and visual media&amp;mdash;as well as potential funding partners&amp;mdash;individuals, philanthropic and corporate&amp;mdash;including developing promotional tie-in and event opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director’s role will also entail coordination of all grant proposals to foundations, governmental organizations and PBS, collaborating closely with WNET Development staff. This individual will manage internal communications between the series and all relevant departments at WNET—the VP Programming, Interactive Engagement, Law, Human Resources, Station Relations, Communications, Program Publicity and especially Development and Major Gifts &amp;ndash;  and will be primarily responsible for working with Communications to coordinate press efforts, press releases and events, including screenings, station outreach events and the TCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the reach of the series through potential digital partnerships, this position will entail continued and expanded work with WNET&amp;rsquo;s in-house on-line and web department to enhance the work currently being done with the series programs, especially in the area of educational materials, DLOs etc. &amp;ndash; including finding the funding to support these expanded efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, candidates must possess a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff. Candidates must also have thorough knowledge of budgets and budget management; of rights and clearance issues; excellent oral and written communication skills; strong planning, organizational and relationship-building skills; knowledge of the independent production community; and ideally, some experience in fundraising.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not a position for an active film-maker or would-be producer for American Masters – though film and production experience will be essential.  Rather, this is a critical senior administrative role in planning, strategy, communications and development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Required Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

				<title>Senior UX Designer, Yammer Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, we work on a product that is changing people&amp;rsquo;s lives at work. We believe that everyone deserves to use software that is useable, simple, and beautiful, whether they use it in their personal lives or for work. Yammer empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent, more equal way of doing their jobs. To change more lives at more companies, we&amp;rsquo;re now a part of Microsoft, but we run independently &amp;ndash; and quickly &amp;ndash; in London and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us lead the London edition of Yammer&amp;rsquo;s User Experience Team as chief user advocate. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a critical part of every London feature from conception to launch, working constantly with product management, research, engineering, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need designers who are great communicators and problem solvers with dead-on interaction instincts, but who know how visual UI design can affect the experience. We need both concise wireframes, and flawless visuals, but we know that they are separate skills and not mutually exclusive to create the best experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

				<title>Front-end Developer at Harvest in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The role that JavaScript plays at Harvest is growing every day. You&amp;rsquo;ll join our front-end team in solving problems, building new features and making Harvest better and better. If you have experience with a nimble team where things progress rapidly then you&amp;rsquo;ll feel right at home at Harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest is a distributed team. We have a lovely big office in New York City, but team members live all over the USA, Canada and Europe. Wherever you currently live, that&amp;rsquo;s where we want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we mention a sense of humor yet? It&amp;rsquo;s important, we like to have fun while we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unrivaled attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing some extra work to make life easier on the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like writing CoffeeScript, but can write vanilla js without breaking a sweat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with Backbone and Ember and have an opion on what makes them good/bad/meh. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve even built projects in both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know that performance is king and have optimized your code for a wide range of browsers and platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write code in a modular, reusable fashion. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve released open source code that demonstrates these qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe that a task is not complete until a test is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;A Sample of Tasks and Projects You Might Work On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build new Harvest features and improve existing components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a select box plugin for use in Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a cross-platform framework to support the mobile web component of Harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a state manager for CSS media queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;To Apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please make sure you fit the descriptions above (see the brain!). You must be authorized to work in the United States (unless you intend to work remotely from your home country).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email us at careers@getharvest.com with the subject &amp;ldquo;Harvest Front-end Developer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to work with us, and why you&amp;rsquo;d make a good fit here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us your thoughts on the eternal JavaScript debate: semicolons &amp;ndash; yes or no?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UX Designer - Yammer (Mobile/Android) Job at Microsoft in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media has dramatically changed the way we share and connect with friends and family, and it will have an even more profound impact on the way companies operate. Yammer and Microsoft provide a secure, private social network for your company. Yammer empowers employees to be more productive and successful by enabling them to collaborate easily, make smarter decisions faster, and self-organize into teams to take on any business challenge. It is a way of working that naturally drives business alignment and agility, reduces cycle times, engages employees and improves relationships with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know devices are the future; come help us design the future of great work software on Android-powered devices. We&amp;rsquo;re building a product that empowers employees to create a healthier, more transparent way of doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yammer team is located in San Francisco, and we maintain the intensity, pragmatism, and velocity of a startup. We release product weekly and projects last weeks, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is structured around designers who are flexible, but who specialize in either visual/UI or interaction/UX. Our UI designers translate wireframes into pixel-perfect, typographically beautiful, development-ready visuals. Your visual designs and ideas are an integral part of what makes a feature stick. You&amp;rsquo;ll be part of feature project teams from the beginning until launch, working side-by-side with a product manager, UX designer, researcher, engineering team, and QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-3 years’ experience working, preferably at more than one past company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated understanding of Android’s User Interface Guidelines through completed design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to demonstrate excellent use of typography, color, imagery, and graphic elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to negotiate and articulate the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of design decisions. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to convince, to disagree confidently, take and give straightforward criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise working daily in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide visual specification and production ready files to engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A portfolio online or in PDF format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The kind of people we&amp;rsquo;re eager to work with are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full of empathy for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated more by shipping product than building a work of art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited that their designs will be validated by qualitative and quantitative research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic and possibly a little bit weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eager to move to a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UIDesigner at Litmus in Cambridge, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re bootstrapped, profitable and proud. You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with our team of
developers building cool stuff, with amazing people. Here&amp;rsquo;s what some of our 11
person crew have to say about Litmus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone. Gives. A. Shit. (about the tech, the products, the customers, each other). Trust and ownership are important here. We build products that scratch our own itch. We experiment, we celebrate (big things (like throwing a launch party), and small (beers at the end of the week)). Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s no red tape, bullshit posturing, timecards or org charts!&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Eddie, Ruby Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aside from software architecture and syntax, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a task that I have begun that I have known how to do. It is a constant learning experience and we often times find ourselves building things that have never been built before.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justin, C# Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re in charge of our own future and aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden by a board, investors or anyone else. I feel like the people I work for care more for our customers and their employees than most other companies do.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Justine, Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Super cool office! &amp;ndash; Our office is amazing and we do a lot of cool things here. Kinect + beer fridays + fun :) It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to get to and a great location.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Danielle, Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &quot;founders&amp;rdquo; are in the thick of it. Also, the collective responsibility, I feel like I could rely on any team member for help.&amp;ldquo;
&lt;strong&gt;James, Account Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About The Position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer everything you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cutting edge, financially successful start
up. Great salary, full health care benefits, 28 days paid vacation (yes, on top of
public holidays!), beautiful office space complete with a Kinect, beer fridge and
Sonos sound system. We also buy you lunch, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the very best money can buy: SSD drives, dual Apple
Displays, Aeron chairs, huge desks, 10&quot; tablets and whatever else you need to be
awesome at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention our office? Seconds from the Central Square T in Cambridge, we have the 11th floor to ourselves. Stunning views, beautiful furniture and top of the line equipment. You have to see it; it&amp;rsquo;s stunning. Design is a key selling point of our products. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone to take over responsibility for all aspects of design and user experience at Litmus. We&amp;rsquo;ll give you all the resources and support you need to craft beautiful, elegant experiences that delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be responsible for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing the user interfaces for all our web-based products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working closely with our development team to oversee the implementation of your designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-ordinating user testing of our product and your own prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping in to help with user experience decisions whenever they arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The ideal candidate has:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio showcasing excellent skills in design and UX principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of layout, typography, color and other design principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>UI Engineer / FrontEndDeveloper at Hearsay Social in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who knows what makes a website look and behave well and also has the random set of skills to actually
make it happen. Someone who is so OCD that she even wants her code to look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who understands that there are living, breathing people at the other end of the tube. They’re impatient.
They read very little. Sometimes they use ancient devices that you wouldn’t touch with a 10 foot pole, but hey they’re your guests and you’re open-minded so you accommodate them. If they can’t figure something out, it&amp;rsquo;s not their fault; it&amp;rsquo;s your fault for building a confusing application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer you believe less is more. You deconstruct a page to its most crucial elements (after figuring out what the most crucial elements are). You show and don’t tell. You realize that we are building a business application and not (thank God) a consumer daily deal site. As such, our site should be timelessly elegant without being trendy. You are consistently consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you want every page to load in a snap. You know that all those &lt;strong&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/strong&gt; cause the browser to chug-a-lug so you use &lt;strong&gt;CSS3 for the bling and kiss the PNGs goodbye&lt;/strong&gt;. You have a visceral reaction to any text that’s part of an image (excepting, of course, logos) because you know it isn&amp;rsquo;t scalable or translatable. Your markup is clean and semantic. You know the difference between &lt;strong&gt;display block, inline and inline-block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what it’s good for but you also know when not to use it. You prefer the &lt;strong&gt;acronym XHR to the misnomer AJAX because it should really be called AJAJ&lt;/strong&gt;. You like to experiment with new paradigms like Backbone but ultimately know it’s just one of many different implementations; it’s the thing you’re implementing that’s important not the technology that gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You secretly know that front end development is harder than back end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-end Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful
ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing
channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way:
organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more
downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as
app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a
slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of
user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong
opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in
everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your
HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire
employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it&lt;/em&gt;. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part
of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying
customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to
becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well compensated&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation
package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome team&lt;/em&gt;. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include
sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We currently have demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

You&amp;rsquo;re clever, efficient, and something else that people can&amp;rsquo;t quite put their finger on, but whatever it is&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s awesome and it needs to create cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You will:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with Creative/Design/Art Directors and Copy Writers to compose engaging online experiences, digital advertising, social content and internal promotional/sales material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate and defend creative decisions, take feedback and push beyond expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research, demonstrate and report on new tools, trends and techniques that can help expand the capability, creativity and expertise of you and the 360i:Recess team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore opportunities and ideas to bring digital into the physical world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and uphold the highest standards of quality, efficiency and organization with regard to creative execution, production and file/asset management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help foster a culture of ideas, experimentation and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;You must have or be:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion: Your significant-other thinks you have A.D.D. (and you might), because the ideas never stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisdom: You have a solid grasp of complex design principles including grid systems, typography, color etc. and can explain them to those that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity: You&amp;rsquo;re addicted to knowledge and inspiration and you&amp;rsquo;re always looking for the next fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast and flexible: Because getting through the stuff we HAVE to, lets us focus on the stuff we WANT to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weapons Expertise: You have a masterful knowledge of creative software and a true understanding of its place within the arsenal. You also know what a pencil is, and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to use it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacGyver: You can solve problems with whatever you have on hand. A font or a color swatch is really all you need to stay &amp;ldquo;on-brand&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Ability: You love figuring out how things work and fixing them when they don&amp;rsquo;t because its the key to making them better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organization: You understand that the only way to a balance your A.D.D. is with a healthy dose of O.C.D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confident: You can speak and write but usually don&amp;rsquo;t need to because your work does most of the talking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personality: A strong sense of humor is an absolute must. Seriously. We&amp;rsquo;re not kidding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent: Be able to work independently and in a team environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chops: A kick-ass portfolio that embodies all of the above and says &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re stupid if you don&amp;rsquo;t hire me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Hobby: You absolutely MUST do something interesting that helps define who you are outside of the office. Sports, Music, Woodworking, Metalworking, Knitting, Cooking, Wine Making ANYTHING!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;It would be nice if you can:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illustrate in 2 and/or 3D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoot/edit video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take amazing photographs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Our clients benefit from the breadth and depth of our global expertise, but more importantly, CSC goes to market using a team of local experts, creating a relaxed, professional-casual atmosphere, while maintaining a family and people-oriented culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we right for you?  CSC offers a variety of challenging opportunities that will draw on your talents while enabling you to grow your intellectual capital in a supportive environment.  Learning experiences are offered as a blend of relevant work assignments, training, tools, mentoring and other growth opportunities.  We offer many avenues to mastering your chosen profession, while giving you everyday exposure to brilliance in business, technology and people.

&lt;p&gt;Career Advancement:  Your career belongs to you. At CSC, we recognize that you are in control of identifying and achieving your career goals.  CSC enables you to take the lead through our formal development planning process.  We will help you create a plan for enhancing your skills and experience by providing information, tools, and people that will support your career planning efforts.  We have identified over 60 standard roles that exist across CSC Consulting, as well as the corresponding skills needed to succeed in those roles.  You can use this information to identify your next assignment or an entire career path anywhere in the U.S. or potentially the world.  A career at CSC can be as targeted or eclectic as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectation for Travel:  For the Global Business Solutions division of CSC, all roles require a commitment to 100% travel.  This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that a person will always be traveling for assignments, but new Consultants joining the CSC team need to understand that they could be assigned to a travel role.  The staffing process focuses on assigning people to local roles as a first priority, however, if a Consultant is available and has the right skills for an assignment for another CSC office across the United States, the Consultant may be staffed into that travel assignment.  When this happens, they travel to the project location at the start of the week, return at the end of the work week and are home during the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Senior Applications Developer at NexGen Poker in Santa Monica, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;NexGen was founded by two serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful in their past startups which were in the web advertising area. Anticipating the law changes in CA to allow online poker and using their experience and numerous contacts they initiated the online poker room idea with an Indian casino partner on the order of 2 years ago. During 2012, the back-end technology for the company was developed by a single person who has extensive experience in the online poker industry. Benefitting from this experience, the current system has been shown to be efficient, fast and scalable to a level that can easily handle the anticipated load of players in CA online poker community ($1B) industry) and eventually a very opportunistic ($35B) global industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Sr. Applications Developer &amp;amp; Systems Specialist * Position Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced architect or advanced developer  of mobile or web games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understands technology trade-offs for development platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has directed game developers on either mobile or web platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop against a variety of web architectures and services (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience managing project within a version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have excellent problem solving skills and love technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be self-motivated and able to multi-task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior experience building native web and mobile apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced developing  with rich media and interactive web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with the majority of: JavaScript, HTML(5), CSS3, JSON, Jquery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced in object oriented design, data structures, design patterns and problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;NexGen&amp;rsquo;s Gaming Product Details &amp;ndash; Desktop (PC &amp;amp; Mac), Web &amp;amp; Mobile (Android &amp;amp; iOS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re developing a legal, regulated online poker system. At this time we have a working core system that can play all the games and is well on its way to being fully compliant with the regulatory requirements that will be in place when legislation passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online poker system that will be the focus of our development has several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core set of services that will run all the games and provide the game results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game play client that will be a downloadable PC program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile versions of the game play client for Web, Android and iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database and back-end reporting capability for company support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company website portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recently demonstrated a complete core system with a demo game play client to our interested parties (regulators and investors). In this demonstration we have shown that not only does the system work, but that it has profound and unique scalability and performance characteristics that will put us in the forefront of being able to provide the top system in this market. We will also be pursuing strategic partnerships to provide this system to other regulated environments both domestic and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a windows shop. However, ff you have an open source background and consider youself the agnostic type with a high stadard for making quality, scalable software, then we&amp;rsquo;d love to connect with and tell you more details surrounding the greatest technology challenge of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Funding &amp;amp; The Legalization of Online Poker in California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is underway and funded by a well-known and big Native American casino. This is an important point because the proposed law states that in order to run an online poker system you must already hold a gaming license in CA. The tribe will also provide the $35-40M required to obtain the license when the licensing process is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legalization of online poker in California is anticipated to be enacted in 2013 with the ability to open the online poker room either in late 2013 or early 2014. The bill for legalization is known as CA Senate Bill 51 which was introduced by Senator Roderick Wright on Dec 21, 2012. It was first introduced by on 2/24/12 as SB 1463 before being withdrawn several months later.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Developer at StudentsFirst in Sacramento, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a national grassroots movement of more than 2 million parents, teachers, students, administrators and concerned citizens mobilizing for one purpose: to put the laws and leaders in place to make students the focus of and ensure America has the best schools in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things the old way for too long.  Pitting the interests of the grown-ups in the system against one another, for example, rather than focusing on real solutions.  No one won. And students lost.  In too many American schools, current laws, policies, and practices are putting adult interests ahead of students. The result is an increasingly broken education system that, if not corrected, will keep America from leading in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new approach that puts students' interests at the center of education policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are channeling the energy of our members to produce meaningful results on both the local and national level. We are working with bipartisan state legislators to create laws and policies that put the needs of students above any other interest in the system. Our members are pushing for reforms that will elevate the teaching profession and improve teacher and principal quality, empower parents and improve the governance and financial strength of school districts. Together, we’ve already helped pass more than 50 new policies in half a dozen states. We have helped improve education systems affecting millions of students. We’re transforming public education to ensure great teachers and great schools for all of our kids. StudentsFirst was founded in 2010 by former Washington D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee.&lt;/p&gt;
