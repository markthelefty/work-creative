				<title>Front-End Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well compensated. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ability to translate technical jargon into meaningful concepts across functional groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently and collaboratively within a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem solving orientation and desire to engage technical challenges and seek the most effective solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience working with web services and APIs like Twitter, Facebook Graph, Instagram, or Google Maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with responsive design and mobile development&lt;/li&gt;
