				<title>Web Developer Front-end at En Masse in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re good at coding intuitive web interfaces, optimizing the performance of web pages, and working with their underlying architecture, we want to talk to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En Masse Entertainment is seeking a Web Developer to extend, refine, and maintain the front-end and back-end aspects of our web presence. This person will work in an open and collaborative environment with friendly, driven professionals, and strive to increase awareness of En Masse and the games we publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who can take design mockups and write prototype code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who can take those prototypes and carve out the appropriate display logic and business rules in Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we&amp;rsquo;d like you to contribute as a key stakeholder in designing simple, intuitive, and engaging web pages. UX isn&amp;rsquo;t the main goal of this position however, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be dinged for having a lack of design/UX experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of typical tasks, over the last few months, our web developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implemented mockups for a new web store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applied a new design to an existing site based on a series of high-fidelity mockups by writing HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or templates in Ruby on Rails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;researched, discussed, and implemented best practices for e-commerce product purchase workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developed a Ruby app (using Sinatra) to utilize a series of API calls for a web storefront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implemented security patches to site dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made our automated tests more robust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wore a wizard hat when they broke the production site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bragged over their current position on the in-house leveling leaderboard for TERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If these tasks sound interesting to you, we&amp;rsquo;d love to see your resume!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in web development or equivalent degree/experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience developing front-end code for websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience developing back-end code for websites is a plus (ideally with Ruby and Ruby on Rails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;familiarity with version control systems, especially Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passion for video games, especially MMORPGs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Fun Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;game area and LAN center on site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free snacks and sodas in the kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open floor plan where team members collaborate with one another on the fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great location in the heart of downtown Seattle. Can you say, “awesome views”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;En Masse employees also enjoy abundant opportunities for professional growth and the potential to learn on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Applying for this Position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When applying for this position, please include the following items in a compressed (.zip) file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code samples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portfolio of previous work (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your favorite meme (and brief explanation why)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may include links to online versions of these resources provided they are universally accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Front-End Web Developer at MobileDevHQ in Seattle, WA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re hiring our first front-end web developer to translate designers' beautiful ideas into an amazing web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App marketers are spending too much time and money on paid app marketing channels, leading to unprofitable downloads. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s a better way: organic app marketing. MobileDevHQ helps mobile app marketers get more downloads by understanding and improving organic marketing channels such as app store search. We are a TechStars Seattle company with seed funding from a slew of fantastic investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a world-class front-end web developer with a strong understanding of user experience who can turn designs into reality through code. You have strong opinions about building beautiful web applications and strive for excellence in everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work directly with our product team to understand users' pains and use cases for our product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with a designer to help build UIs to solve these pains and use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement these interfaces into our product with your HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What you need to be hired at MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience taking Photoshop work and turning it into a living, breathing web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bonus points for Ruby on Rails (or HAML and SASS) experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love for mobile and marketing. Apps are taking over the world, and we help large enterprises succeed in the app ecosystem through smart marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience building beautiful dashboards for businesses to complete complicated workflows and feel good while doing so is a huge bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with responsive design is also a bonus, given that our users are frequently working on desktops, tablets, and phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to learn that trumps everything else. We aren&amp;rsquo;t building an average company, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want average employees. We hire employees who love learning and aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to dive head-first into the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Why you want to join MobileDevHQ:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re crushing it. Users are finding our tools to be an indispensible part of their app marketing. We&amp;rsquo;ve signed up hundreds of active paying customers in just a few short months and are well on our way to becoming the single dashboard for all organic app marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well compensated. We&amp;rsquo;re a startup, but we offer a full compensation package. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive salary, equity (in the form of stock options), and benefits (medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome team. Our team is the best, and we treat each other like family. We&amp;rsquo;re a group of talented, diverse, and fun people. We include sports fans, musicians, foodies, rock climbers, and more. We have competitive ping pong games daily &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a fancy ping pong paddle upon joining the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
