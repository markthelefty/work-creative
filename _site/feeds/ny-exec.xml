				<title>Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager at StyledOn in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;StyledOn.com is a VC-backed startup based in NY and LA focused on creating the largest style centric social network — we are well on our way, but we need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a marriage of fashion and technology. If this sounds appealing to you, check our current openings and see if your skill set matches. However, if you don’t see something that matches your skills or tickles your fancy, and you think you are good enough for us to create a job for you, we invite you to send us your resume with an email on why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all busy here at StyledOn, so don’t send us fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more creative, the more thoughtful, the better your chances! Email positions@styledon.com with your proposed title in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How we define Product Management:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Management brings our ideas to fruition. This takes a supernatural ability to be both technical and creative, and, most importantly, to project manage to successful launch. StyledOn is creating a social network that is laser focused on “style”, and we are looking for individuals who are masters at creating, managing, and nurturing both online social mediums and mobile products. Product management is our guiding light as to what our market wants/craves/needs and helps our marketing department in positioning, packaging, and promoting the products that are created—after all, no one is more passionate than the creator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The role: Director of Product Management / Senior Product Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StyledOn is looking for a Product Jedi Master. We are in the troughs of re-launching our online properties and creating our mobile applications and we need a hard-nosed, battle-tested technologist who knows how to bring to market a hatched idea. He/she needs to be ambitious and self-managed with a proven track record of defining, creating and managing market leading interactive products in a consumer-facing environment. We employ both internal shared resources and outsourced development houses to accomplish our product goals, so we are looking for someone who also has experience managing a diverse development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities boiled down:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Develop a deep understanding of the competitive landscape in our vertical through analysis, user research and site testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead usability tests, feasibility studies, review web analytics and conduct user research to deliver high-quality products that meet user needs, or, better yet, create new user “needs”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own and manage every aspect of the product lifecycle and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly define requirements at a functional and technical level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope project strategies, initiatives, budgets and resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop project plan and resource allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain overall product and feature roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and present hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and feature concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define, monitor and report progress against key success metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate product strategies and objectives into specific tactical plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, most importantly, EXECUTE on plan and hit timelines and targets!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BA/BS in Computer Science or a related technical field preferred (MS or Ph.D is a plus).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience in working on online content businesses, and in particular, experience in building online communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in product design and management of mobile products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product management record (e.g. writing MRDs and PRDs, performing competitive analysis, creating product roadmaps, creating presentations that communicate product features &amp;amp; benefits, defining user interfaces, creating wireframes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical thinker with exceptional verbal and written skills; this individual is the communication hub of product-related matters and must be able to communicate effectively with different roles in the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong business acumen and grasp of business fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical, organizational, and problem solving skills with ability to interpret data into key learnings and product strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-starter and team player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of comfort with working closely with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High integrity and a record of excellence in your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A true passion for product design and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the “social sphere” space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and oral communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent organizational and analytical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong technical abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in project managing outsourced development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;How to apply:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive hundreds of resumes and we can’t read them all. If you are interested in this position, and consider your skill set a good fit, do more than just send us your resume. If you are serious about being considered and want us to spend our time in reviewing your qualifications, then you should spend your time in presenting to us why you are a good fit. Include in your email something, anything that separates you from the crowd. Get creative! Get inventive! Give us your ideas of a product roadmap. Tell us where we are falling short. Give us your idea on a mobile app. We dare you to come up with something that makes us salivate so we can’t wait to hire you!&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;American Masters, Thirteen/WNET’s award-winning biography series, celebrates our arts and culture. Created and launched in 1986 by Executive Producer Susan Lacy, the series set the standard for documentary film profiles, accruing widespread critical acclaim – 50 Emmy nominations and 23 awards – including for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 – the 2012 Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Producer of Non-Fiction Television; an Oscar, three Grammys and 12 Peabody Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Masters has produced an exceptional library of 180 titles, bringing unique originality and perspective to exploring the lives and illuminating the creative journeys of our most enduring writers, musicians, visual and performing artists, dramatists and filmmakers – those who have “left an indelible impression on our cultural landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the Executive Producer of American Masters, this newly created position is responsible for devising and implementing short- and long-range strategies for enlarging and stabilizing the American Masters franchise, with a senior role in both external and internal (WNET) initiatives and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director will be responsible for developing innovative thinking and forging relationships to further the reach and scope of the series beyond broadcast into the digital space, publishing, creative partnerships with universities, libraries and other organizations; for evaluating and activating renewed and original exploitation of the assets of the American Masters archive; for considering and planning new spin-offs, sub-sets, mini-series etc. based on existing and future American Masters programming &amp;ndash; all with an eye to maximizing the educational,digital, social media and revenue producing possibilities for both the existing library and future productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort will entail developing media and other creative partnerships&amp;mdash;both digital and analog, in film, production, literary and visual media&amp;mdash;as well as potential funding partners&amp;mdash;individuals, philanthropic and corporate&amp;mdash;including developing promotional tie-in and event opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director’s role will also entail coordination of all grant proposals to foundations, governmental organizations and PBS, collaborating closely with WNET Development staff. This individual will manage internal communications between the series and all relevant departments at WNET—the VP Programming, Interactive Engagement, Law, Human Resources, Station Relations, Communications, Program Publicity and especially Development and Major Gifts &amp;ndash;  and will be primarily responsible for working with Communications to coordinate press efforts, press releases and events, including screenings, station outreach events and the TCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the reach of the series through potential digital partnerships, this position will entail continued and expanded work with WNET&amp;rsquo;s in-house on-line and web department to enhance the work currently being done with the series programs, especially in the area of educational materials, DLOs etc. &amp;ndash; including finding the funding to support these expanded efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, candidates must possess a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Broadcast Communications, Production, or a related field, and at least 10 years experience in senior broadcast/production/arts production or managerial roles with direct supervisory responsibility for staff.

&lt;p&gt;Candidates with solid experience as executive or senior producer or in a development &amp;amp; planning role, in network, cable or independent production, with a successful history of developing projects, creating alliances, and fundraising – are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not a position for an active film-maker or would-be producer for American Masters – though film and production experience will be essential.  Rather, this is a critical senior administrative role in planning, strategy, communications and development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
