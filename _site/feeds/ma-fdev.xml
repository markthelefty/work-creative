				<title>Web Developer at Tufts University in Medford, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Web Communications, a department under University Relations, uses the web and emerging technologies to engage a diverse audience, including students, prospective students, parents, alumni, faculty, staff, donors and external media, with the Tufts story. To that end, the department is responsible for creating and implementing the university&amp;rsquo;s web communications strategy; managing internal and external online communications channels; and developing content, tools and services for Tufts.edu and related sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
