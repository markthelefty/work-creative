				<title>Web Programmer/Developer at Smarterer in Boston, MA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You love to build products. You love to hack on web code. You love large scaling challenges, neat and complex algorithms, and working with a talented passionate team making a dent in the universe. You should work at Smarterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to measure the world’s skills. We’re tapping into the fundamental need for people to be able to measure what they know, engaging the increasing number of digital tools that are part of everyone’s lives, and building a reliable way to prove skills to others (peers, employers, and the world). We’re small but growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In joining our team, you’ll have a strong voice in our technology and product. We also believe that hacking is akin to painting so we’re not shy about making sure you’ll have the exact right tools for you to get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who we’re looking for:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal fit for us would be someone with a strong passion for programming, interest in the whole web technology stack, interest in the philosophy and details of actually making web products work (deployment, testing, as well as dev management and principles). The ideal candidate wants to “own” big pieces of the vision and functionality. We’re very interested in (but not limited to) people who identify themselves as “full stack” developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a coding position, you’ll be a core member of the technology team, deeply involved in both the design and implementation of our technology. Our stack is mostly Javascript and Python using a lightweight, open source, semi-custom framework but our search is not limited to “python people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culturally, we’re low-ego and friendly, but super passionate about what we do. We’re looking for someone who is as passionate as we are and who strongly fits with the existing team. As a member of the core team, you’ll not only help us shape our technology and product, but will also help form the culture of our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you’re good with (or very interested in) these technologies
JavaScript, Python, Ruby, MySQL, AWS (or other cloud providers), Django, SQLAlchemy, Pylons, WSGI, NoSQL, memcached, REST design principles, API design and integration, async/concurrent IO programming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boston:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re based right in the middle of the Boston/Cambridge tech scene with hundreds of startups, over 500 regular tech and programming meet-ups and events, and tens of thousands of smart, motivated people building cool, innovative products. Boston is a great place to live and work, with a rich startup and technology ecosystem. If you’re not already in Boston, reach out and we’ll tell you more about why this is the perfect place for a developer to build their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smarterer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smarterer scores digital, social, and technical skills using crowdsourced test design and an adaptive scoring algorithm. In the past year, Smarterer users have taken more than 1.9 million tests and answered almost 20 million questions.  Our vision: Become the global standard in skills measurement. The opportunity? Huge!  Smarterer is backed by Google Ventures and True Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Debugging and solving cross-browser issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard design tools (Photoshop, Illustrator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience deploying code in a LAMP environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in user-experience (UX), usability and web accessibility standards and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of current popular APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to brainstorm creative solutions to problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience collaborating with a diverse, multidisciplinary team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire to learn and apply new skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Preferred Qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to edit in Flash/Flex/ActionScript to support existing web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong focus on front-end design and modern web practices to create an efficient user-experience&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;On-site SEO best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in higher education a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
