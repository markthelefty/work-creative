&lt;p&gt;Game Designers are responsible for creating games played by millions of people around the world. Game design is a highly creative and specialized craft. Some games can be developed relatively quickly, while others can take many years to go from an idea all the way into the hands of our consumers. Like many other jobs in gaming, game design is becoming increasingly specialized. On the most basic level, it’s the responsibility of the game designer to make games fun. A game designer defines the game and outlines it’s progression in a game design document, which is a blueprint for game design that includes information about the game’s characters, worlds, story, and more. Everyone wants to be the next Will Wright, Steven Spielberg, Neil Young or Alex Ward but few are as the creation of a great gaming experience, holding the attention of millions of gamers for many hours, is a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Role Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Designers are responsible for devising what a game consists of and how it plays, following the vision of the Creative/Game Director. They plan and define all the elements and components of a game, including its setting, structure, rules, story flow, characters, objects, vehicles, and devices available to the characters; interface design; and game modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originality and creativity are valued, but a thorough knowledge of a game’s target audience and market is equally if not more important. Game Designers should also have a deep understanding of the capabilities and benefits of different hardware platforms (e.g., PC, console, mobile devices), as well as familiarity with software technologies and techniques appropriate to each platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the Game Designer’s responsibility to ensure that the whole team understands and shares the original concept and vision of the game as outlined by the Creative/Game Director. During development, the Game Designer makes adjustments to the original specification to respond to technical constraints and to incorporate new programming and art creation methods developed by the team. The Game Designer also trains testers to play the game, making sure that they understand what is expected of the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What skills does EA look for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no set route to becoming a Game Designer. However, this is not an entry level role. Game development is a highly complex, intensive process which can last two years or more, so the Game Designer must be able to work closely with teams of programmers, artists, project managers, writers, musicians, and many others. The Game Designer usually has a reasonably high level of industry experience and knowledge. EA usually expects to see a portfolio of work, which can take the form of completed game projects or written game design documents and proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game development is a collaborative process involving multi-disciplinary teams. Designers must be able to communicate their vision to artists, programmers, producers, marketing staff, and others involved in the development process, and accept feedback on their work. This involves presenting their ideas both verbally and on paper, for which they need writing and basic visual design and drawing skills. They should also be reasonably fluent in a range of 2D and 3D graphics and animation packages, such as 3D Studio Max or Maya. Good technical knowledge is required, with some programming skills at least at ‘scripting’ level and awareness of the various games platforms and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common route to becoming a Game Designer is to get experience as a Game Tester and/or in Quality Assurance (QA) department for a games company. This offers a good grounding in the development process, access to software and tools, and insight into the different job roles in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking for Game Designers EA values a thorough understanding of gameplay theory. Excellent communication and presentation skills are a must, along with storytelling and narrative development skills. The ideal candidate possesses information design and user interface design skill. They must be able to work both as part of a team and independently. Last but not least, they must display systematic and strategic thinking as well as imagination and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as educational background, Game Designers can study a range of subjects, from the sciences and humanities to art and design. There are also a growing number of games-related degree programs and courses available for study, and a degree in this type of program would be a plus. Prospective Game Designers should check the content of courses, particularly the balance between programming, game art, and game design. Designers need basic programming and 3D design skills, and preferably some drawing ability. It’s also very important to have excellent communication and presentation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
