				<title>Visual Interface Designer at Vertigo Software, Inc. in Point Richmond, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an experienced visual interface designer to join our design practice at Vertigo. Our company, with offices in California and Oregon, designs and builds world-class interactive products for brand name clients across a broad range of industries. Every team member has the opportunity to work with a variety of platforms (Web, iOS, Windows 8, Xbox, Android) and clients, each one presenting a unique creative challenge. At Vertigo we work in a multi-disciplinary approach. Our engineering practice understands the exceptional value that good design brings to the products we build – you will see your design ideas implemented in the final product pretty much as you intended. And we ship or launch 99.9% of what we start. That’s pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What We’re Looking For&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost you are passionate about solving real-world visual design challenges. But of course you have a solid knowledge of visual design skills, processes and deliverables and know how to apply them to interactive products. You love color, typography, and a good sketch, and you’re willing to push creative boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a creative visual thinker who can successfully plan and prioritize your work, but you’re at your best in collaborative team environments. You have strong communication skills and can clearly articulate your design concepts to internal teams and clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how to shepherd your designs through the project lifecycle from hand sketch to final artwork. You pay close attention to detail and you’re willing to iterate, refine and polish the design to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you love working with smart, talented, fun people in a creative atmosphere of collaboration doing the best work possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Desired Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of typography, color, layout, data visualization, and brand systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for application-specific contexts – UI controls, iconography, device resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of common visual design tools – pencils to pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design experience for iOS, Android, modern web standards and Microsoft platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to facilitate or participate in design ideation sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work productively with engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the needs of a consulting business: time, scope and budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure to  Scrum or Agile development methodologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client consulting experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing desire to learn and to share what you know with your colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction design or web development skills are a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with motion graphics or animation a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please include a link to an online portfolio in your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
