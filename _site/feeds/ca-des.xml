				<title>User Interface (UI) Designer at Liftopia in San Francisco, CA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our products are nothing without easy-to-use and straight-forward interfaces that get out of people&amp;rsquo;s way and help users achieve their goals (in this case, getting out to the slopes!). We&amp;rsquo;re looking to expand our product/design team by adding a designer who believes usability is an important component to badass online experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This role requires a mix of user interface and visual design skills. You will be working on multiple web and mobile products- a mix of enterprise, mobile and consumer/e-commerce applications. This is not a position meant for specialist visual designers or pure information architects.  If you believe usability &amp;amp; delight goes beyond (but still works closely with) visual aesthetics, this may very well be the perfect role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online portfolio is required to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working on web and/or mobile applications in the consumer space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong design background with expert knowledge of page hierarchy, typography, color theory, and branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience developing and designing: wireframes, mockups, site maps, storyboards, task flows, design specifications, and/or landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You find little touches of personality in interfaces delightful and make an effort to bring that kind of &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; feel to your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility in learning new ways of doing and thinking through problems; comfortable with testing to validate theories and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work within, manage and extend design styleguides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full understanding of modern web standards and the design implications of CSS-based layout are also required. Must know how HTML/CSS/JS make your designs possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert in web design tools (ie: Fireworks, Photoshop, llustrator, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Axure, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with usability testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to drive design concepts and present early stage sketches &amp;amp; wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable in a fast-paced, rapidly-growing environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess a self-motivated, &amp;ldquo;git &amp;lsquo;er done&amp;rdquo; work ethic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 years minimum experience designing interfaces that incorporate &amp;amp; extend a brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;PLUSES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototyping code abilities (HTML, CSS, light JS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise user interface design experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;IS LIFTOPIA A GOOD FIT FOR YOU?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the typical startup/tech industry benefits (like unlimited vacation, health insurance, bonus pool, flexible schedule, stock options, and so on), Liftopia would be a great fit if you identify with any (or all!) of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to work with equally motivated and smart people to create Awesome Stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued learning via workshops, conferences, classes, etc is important to you. We want to support you in your desire &amp;amp; effort to grow and remain relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company culture &amp;ndash; like grabbing beers after work or kayaking with teammates on Liftopia Days &amp;ndash; appeals and is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy snow and even skiing/snowboarding/snowshoeing/kite-skiing/snow-camping/cat-skiing/alpine-touring/heli-skiing/snowmobiling/crosscountry-skiing/sledding/tubing/luging OR you&amp;rsquo;re curious to learn (many of us are first-time skiers/snowboarders!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is about much more than a paycheck. So much time is spent working; it should be enjoyable, you should be continuing to grow, and you should be able to find satisfaction in what you produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;ABOUT LIFTOPIA&lt;/h2&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com transformed the enterprise software market with cloud computing. We’ve launched business apps and platforms that are as easy to use as Amazon.com and as social as Facebook. Recognized as the world’s most innovative company and the third fastest-growing technology company by Forbes and for the third consecutive year in 2011 selected as one of the &amp;ldquo;Best Places to Work&amp;rdquo; by FORTUNE magazine, we now have our sights set on the next generation of cloud computing. Our technology teams are the brains behind visionary technologies like the Force.com platform, and enterprise social collaboration tools like Salesforce Chatter and the AppExchange marketplace. With more than 7,000 employees, the first enterprise cloud computing company to exceed $2.0B in annual revenue run rate, and more than 100,000 customers worldwide, we are proud to contribute to the success of companies of all sizes and industries, around the globe. If you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about innovation, come help revolutionize how companies collaborate and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk.com is a fast-paced startup inside Salesforce.com, which means you get the best of both worlds: small teams, fun projects, and fast execution backed by the vast resources of a publicly traded company. We have the cool vibe of a startup and the dependability of an established player. We are headquartered in San Francisco and have really cool offices south of Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a highly-motivated Sr. UI Designer with a strong understanding of design, to contribute in shaping the user interface of our product and strengthening our online presence across web, tablet, and mobile devices. We drive our product by the user experience, and need someone with the skills who can keep up and push the vision forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will work directly with other members of the product team to build experiences that reinforce the Desk.com brand and help wow our customers. You will get to work in an exciting and engaging agile startup-like environment where you will be encouraged to expand your skills, test your creative boundaries, share new ideas, and most importantly – have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Work directly with product managers, front-end engineers, and other UI designers to insure we maintain a high-quality user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with your team to meet the demands of our customers, while at the same time continuing to innovate far beyond the competition. .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Required/Desired Skills:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a master of your craft and tools. As a designer you are expected to have a dominating control over Photoshop, as well as create satisfying interfaces boasting user-centered design principles for our core applications. Bonus for a dribbble or other online portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get excited to work with some of the coolest clients on the web on a product that people love using. With customers like 37signals, Rdio, Square, Pandora, many more, we’re building software that real companies are using and we need you to contribute to our evolution. You must be excited about your role! Anybody can build something that’s “good”, but true passion breeds “incredible.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You like to deliver real results. So, you’ve got some design and prototyping chops but do you have the ability to bring your work to life? This is a great opportunity to expand your front-end skills, and learn from an exceptionally talented team. You’ll need to be able to build those great experiences with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bonus if terms like HAML, CoffeeScript, and AngularJS not only make sense to you, but excite you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On occasion, you will have to receive feedback from our customers &amp;ndash; so excellent written and oral communication skills are a must!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
