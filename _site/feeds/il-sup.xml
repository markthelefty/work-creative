				<description>&lt;p&gt;BigMachines is the global leader in delivering cloud-based mission critical applications to the Fortune 2000.  Our industry-leading solutions help companies Sell More and Sell Faster, configuring, pricing, and quoting their complex products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the fifth consecutive year we had two great distinctions: landing on the &amp;ldquo;Inc 5000 list of Fastest Growing Companies&amp;rdquo; and being voted #1 on Salesforce&amp;rsquo;s AppExchange.

We do all of this while managing to maintain an industry-leading 95% customer retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking to add exceptional talent across our entire company of great people who play hard as a reward for working even harder.  At BigMachines, we thrive on using unique and unconventional methods to drive remarkable employee success.
