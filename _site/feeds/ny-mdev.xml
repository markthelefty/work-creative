				<title>Mobile Developer at Mobiquity in New York, NY</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone in our niche knows what’s differentiates those with talent, those with vision and the unique individual who has both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobiquity&amp;rsquo;s products are enterprise level mobile applications with the backing to make them the best. We don&amp;rsquo;t design products, pop them on an app store, cross our fingers and pray. The applications you will be involved in aren&amp;rsquo;t just cutting edge, they are tools that are defining the next generation. They are also tools that are going to be deployed by Fortune 1000 firms looking to make sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t left in the dumpster of history because they were blacksmiths in the age of the automobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also are a great environment to work in, with some of the  best names  in the industry. These guys and gals aren&amp;rsquo;t sitting in an Ivory Tower either, they are sleeves up and involved in the day to day. Our developers learn new tools and techniques every day because they are working with the people who invent them. Competitive Salary, bonuses, perks and all those cool things you find at startups (Those with solid funding, a huge client list, and an experienced executive team, anyways) just make the day to day code go that much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an Android Developer, I/OS Developer, or someone who likes to dabble in a bit of this and that as it relates to Mobile Development then chances are we have a place for you. We are seeking all levels of skill in those areas but even more we are looking for people ready for the next step. Both the next steps in their careers, the next steps in the hottest technology and the combination of a solid business model with the environment of creativity and flexibility all artists need,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to engage in projects that will challenge your skills in an awesome environment, ready to taste success because the business side understands the tech side and have fun doing it, then why aren&amp;rsquo;t we talking?&lt;/p&gt;
