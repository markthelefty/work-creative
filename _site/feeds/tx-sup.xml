				<title>Technical Support Representative at HomeAway in Austin, TX</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;HomeAway Technical Support Representatives are responsible for providing phone and email customer support for the HomeAway suite of Web sites. We are looking for someone who enjoys solving problems for other people, has a medium-to-strong technical background (we will provide training on our products and services), and can explain complex ideas and concepts in a clear, simple manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical Support Representatives require both an intimate knowledge of product as well as some extended general technical knowledge of web browser technologies, operating systems and hardware.  Interfacing directly with our customers, they should possess strong communication skills and be able to explain technical concepts in a way best understood by the individual they are working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Identify, troubleshoot and where possible resolve issues that have been escalated from Customer Support and provide support via phone and email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain expert knowledge on HomeAway products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and Reproduce Product Defects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and handle Customer errors gracefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute knowledge gained back to CS through documentation of issue resolutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help to analyze and identify issue severity levels and follow appropriate escalation procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate customers in best practices for using HomeAway applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet agreed upon and expected service levels for case completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the customer’s primary point of contact through resolution, and delight the customer throughout that process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an advocate for the voice of the customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Job Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum of 1–2 years experience as a customer support representative, ideally in a technical capacity for a consumer Web site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated excellent verbal and written communication skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Windows XP, Vista and 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Apple OSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with browser technologies including a thorough understanding of cookies, security controls, extensions and add-ons of popular browsers like IE, FireFox and Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with MS Office suite including Outlook, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint&lt;/li&gt;
