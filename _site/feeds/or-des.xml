				<title>UI Designer at Act-On Software in Beaverton, OR</title>
				<description>&lt;h2&gt;What you would do:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our growing and passionate team you&amp;rsquo;ll participate in everything from initial planning and sketches right through design and implementation. You&amp;rsquo;ll be based in our Beaverton, Oregon office, designing world-class UIs that are perfectly simple and eminently usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how we work:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work in an agile team environment. We discuss a project, make prototypes, code them up, then work with developers to make sure those designs look and work exactly as intended. You&amp;rsquo;ll also work alongside our testers, who are great at spotting usability problems. As a designer you&amp;rsquo;re engaged in the whole process â€“ from conception to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing automation website integration experience required. (Domain expertise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated knowledge of best practices for the design of digital interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid experience in interaction strategy, user research/usability testing, and the construction of software prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with visual design, skinning wireframes, icons, and style guide creation preferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A demonstrated design sensibility and a knack for producing effective, engaging interaction prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
